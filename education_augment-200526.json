He attended a one-room schoolhouse for the first six grades, with only three in his class but plenty of opportunity to 'skip ahead' due to the commingled age groups. Hess received his ((NAM: B.S.)) in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 1946 at the age of 19. In his privately published ``Wilmot's World'' biography, he says ``I took the test to get into the Navy V-12 program.... We had military drills and wore Navy uniforms, but ((PRO: it)) was mostly just going to college. The first entry in our Navy log every day started out 'USS Hartley Hall securely moored at Broadway and 116th Street.... ' The Commodore in charge of all Naval Officer Procurement had his office in our building. We apprentice seamen stood watch near his door. At 4 pm we had to go in and say (with a straight face): ''Sir, the time is reported as 1600. The galley fires are out and the prisoners are ashore. `` If you smiled during the presentation, you might be thrown in the brig (jail).'' He was 87th in his family line to go to Oberlin College, where he received his M.A. in Physics in 1949. Hess then attended the University of California at Berkeley where he received his Ph.D. in Physics in 1954."

Ilya Schor was a painter, jeweler and artist of Judaica, and Resia Schor was a painter who later worked in silver and gold and mixed media on sculptural jewelry and Judaica. The Schors lived among a polyglot community of emigres, among them musicians, intellectuals, and artists. Naomi Schor's first language was French, and she went to the Lycee Francais de New York where she received her Baccalaureat in 1961, the same year, sadly, that her father died. Schor received her ((NAM: B.A.)) in English Literature from Barnard College then received her PhD in French Literature from Yale. There Schor occasionally wrote her scholarly essays in French."

In 1920, Vacquier escaped the Russian Civil War with his family, taking a horse-drawn sleigh across the ice of the Gulf of Finland to Helsinki, then moving to France and (in 1923) to the United States. He received a ((NAM: B.S.)) in electrical engineering in 1927 from the University of Wisconsin, and a master's degree in physics in 1929, but never earned a Ph.D. He worked for Gulf Research Laboratories, the research arm of Gulf Oil, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then during World War II he moved to the Airborne Instruments Laboratory at Columbia University, where he applied the fluxgate magnetometer, an instrument he had invented at Gulf, to submarine detection. Following the war, he worked at Sperry Gyroscope Inc. developing gyrocompasses; then in 1953 he moved to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where he worked on groundwater detection. At Scripps, where he moved in 1957, he directed a program that used his war-surplus flux magnetometers to measure the patterns formed by the Earth's magnetic field on the sea floor; his discovery of large shifts in the patterns in the Mendocino Fracture Zone was a major impetus behind the theory of plate tectonics, which his later measurements of heat flow on the sea floor also strongly supported."

The Golden Bamboo Lemur is considered one of the most endangered primates on earth. Dr. Wright lists the creation in 1991 of the 43,500 hectare Ranomafana National Park among her greatest accomplishments. In 1995, Dr. Wright was honored to receive a knighthood from the Government of Madagascar (Officier de lOrdre National), in recognition of her years of hard work in collaboration with Malagasy scientists and government officials. She is an AAAS Fellow, a Hauptman-Woodward Medal award winner, has received honorary degrees from the University of Antananarivo (Honoris Causa) and Hood College. Dr. Wright received a ((NAM: B.A.)) in Biology from Hood College and a Ph.D. in Anthropology from City University of New York. She has been on the Board of the Wenner-Gren Foundation, The Duke Lemur Center and the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration and the NGS Conservation Trust. Her recent book Madagascar: The Forest of Our Ancestors has a strong conservation component. Dr. Wright has spearheaded Malagasy Biodiversity research and the founding of the Centre ValBio (CVB) Research Campus in 2003. CVB is located adjacent to Ranomafana National Park near the town of Ranomafana, Madagascar. The campus provides modern research facilities steps away from a unique tropical rainforest and has the multi-faceted mission of biodiversity research, conservation and humanitarian outreach."

On his return to Germany he was invited to join a new advanced course in aeronautical engineering being offered by the DVL research institute in Berlin. Following in Frank Whittle's footsteps of a few years earlier, Schelp became interested in the problems of high-speed flight, and attempted to calculate the maximum speed an aircraft could obtain. He eventually came to the conclusion that flights over Mach 0.82 were impossible due to the decreasing efficiency of propellers, which one of his professors at DVL demonstrated would be only 71% at Mach 0.82, and falling rapidly. For higher speeds a much larger engine would be needed, one whose weight would offset the amount of thrust that could be generated by the propeller. He was aware of developments in jet engines, and became convinced they were the only way forward."

In 1974 he completed his Ph.D. dissertation at Ohio State University on Byzantine Jewry during the Paeleologue period. He was appointed to the faculty of Judaic Studies in the University of Cincinnati in 1980, and became a full Professor in 1990. Bowman published The Jews of Byzantium, 1204-1453 in 1985, followed by several books exploring the history of the Greek Jews during the Second World War. His fourth book, The Agony of Greek Jews, 1940-1945, was described by K.E. Fleming as one which ``produced a careful and multilayered examination of Greek Jewry's most devastating five years'', was characterized by Nikos Tzafleris as ``the most complete chronicle to date of the Holocaust of Greek Jewry'' and by Aristotle Kallis as a ``fascinating book'' including a ``complex set of stories relating to individuals, families, and entire communities''. In 2011 Bowman finished his Annotated Translation of Sepher Yosippon, to be published in 2012 as the first book of the Hackmey Jewish Classics series at Harvard University. Bowman is the editor in chief of the Sephardi and Greek Holocaust Library that has published several Greek Holocaust memoirs and had edited many other books."

He was named an assistant professor in 1928, associate professor in 1931 and full professor in 1941. In 1965 he was named the first Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering. He became professor emeritus in 1968. Hottel was in charge of solar energy research program at MIT from the late 1930s to the mid 1960s. This involved research on non-biological uses of solar energy by humanity. The work led to develop the first accurate analytical models for solar heat collectors. The modeling and testing work on led to what is currently known as the Hottel-Whillier model of the flat plate collector."

His parents, Adrian August Wedemeyer and Laura Marie Marks Wedemeyer strived to provide books and magazines and an environment conducive to learning. An avid reader, the young Wedemeyer made great use of his local library in his quest for knowledge. He received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Science)) degree in Education with a major in English, later pursuing a Master's Degree in English, both from the University of Wisconsin-- Madison and Northwestern University. As a young educator, he taught English and ((NAM: Science)) to disadvantaged youth. It was at that time that he began to formulate his progressive ideas on extending educational opportunities as integral to the democratic project."

His stay in a predominantly Structuralist and Marxist France influenced Janzen's ideology and led him to the belief that material existence shapes societies and ideas. Janzen rejected the notion of a solely symbolic anthropology. This experience would resurface in his later works on African health and healing. John returned home to complete his graduate studies and finish his Master's thesis titled: Towards a History of Cultural Revitalization among the Bakongo: 1880-1925. John received an ((NAM: M.A.)) in Anthropology from the University of Chicago in May 1964, and began his PhD at the University of Chicago soon after. John also married his undergraduate love, Reinhild Kauenhoven, the same year. She has since then provided John with a strong sense of support, accompanied him during his fieldwork in the lower Congo, and eventually, co-authored two books with him."

        "snippet": "Leigh Lisker (1918--2006) was an eminent American linguist and phonetician. Most of his career was spent at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor and then emeritus professor of linguistics. Dr. Lisker received his ((NAM: A.B.)) in 1941, with a major in German, his M.A. in 1946, and a Ph.D. in 1949 in linguistics. He was a major figure in phonetics, working both at the University of Pennsylvania and at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, CT, where he was a senior scientist from 1951 until the end of his life. He collaborated with several phoneticians, principally Arthur S. Abramsonhttp://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/abramson.html. He is best known for his work, done mostly in conjunction with Abramson, on voice onset time. Dr. Lisker also made important contributions to Dravidian linguistics, including the book Introduction to Spoken Telugu (Telugu), and did research comparing phonetic and phonological perceptions on the part of linguistically naive and linguistically sophisticated speakers of different native language backgrounds. He conducted such studies in collaboration with Dr. Abramson of the University of Connecticut, Bh. Krishnamurti http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/lisker/lisker-krishna.html of University of Hyderabad, India, Adrian Fourcin http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/adrian/home.htm of University College London, and Mario Rossi http://aune.lpl.univ-aix.fr/lpl/personnel/rossi/mariorossi.htm of the Institut de Phonetique at the Universite de Provence, Aix-en-Provence."

He received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Science)) in general engineering in 1957, a Master of Science in mechanical engineering in 1958, and a second Master of Science in chemical engineering in 1960. After college, Koch started work at Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1961 he moved back to Wichita to join his father's business, Rock Island Oil & Refining Company. In 1967 he became president of the business, which was then a medium-sized oil firm. In the same year, he renamed the firm Koch Industries in honor of his father. By 2006, Koch Industries generated $90 billion in revenue, a growth of 2000 times over, which represents an annual compounded return of 18%."

There Luckey was primarily mentored by his Faculty Advisor Alan Armer, the founding President of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Producer of the 1960s series The Untouchables and The Fugitive and the 70s series Cannon. Another key influence on Luckey was screenwriter-producer Benjamin Brady, the former President of ABC Television who had produced the series Perry Mason and co-created, with Raymond Burr, the series Ironside. Luckey also studied under such industry veterans as Nat Perrin (The Adams Family), Tom Burrows (director of the '60 Kennedy-Nixon TV debate), Peter Stearn( Happy Days, The Partridge Family), Beretta and Dr. Kildare writer-producer Irv Pearlberg and Academy Award (Oscar) winning writer-director Sydney Salkow who, despite his work on over 75 feature films, was best known as the producer of Lassie, I Love Lucy and its follow-up The Lucy Show. Luckey received his ((NAM: B.A.)) in Radio-Television-Film, Media Management in 1988."

Although Lemelson died on October 1, 1997, Hosier continued to litigate to enforce Lemelson's patents on behalf of Lemelson's heirs, including the Lemelson Medical, Educational and Research Foundation (Lemelson Foundation). The American Lawyer reported his annual income for 2003 at $150 million. Lemelson was a noted philanthropist, Hosier was once known as a boastful and lavish spender. but Hosier has set up a Hosier family foundation that makes many charitable contributions, such as being a major sponsor of the Aspen Institute. In 2004, the key Lemelson patents on bar code scanning were declared invalid for prosecution laches (unduly delaying the patent application process so as to issue the patents long after the invention would have been thought to be public domain.) and this loss has reduced Hosier's income and influence. Gerald Hosier received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Science)) in Electrical Engineering from Northwestern University and obtained his Juris Doctor from DePaul University College of Law. He is also registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a registered patent attorney. Hosier also currently serves on the Board of Trustees for the Aspen Institute."

Yongseong attained enlightenment during this period at Songgwangsa. He spent the coming years practicing Seon meditation and studying the Korean Tripitaka at monasteries and temples throughout Korea, engaging many masters in Dharma combat. Beginning in 1903 he began leading discussions on Seon and Pure Land Buddhism with various students, and also set about building meditation halls for temples and repaired the Tripitaka woodblocks housed at Haeinsa. From 1907 to 1908 he traveled through parts of China, where he visited various temples and masters. According to the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism's website, ``To a Chinese monk who arrogantly praised the superiority of Chinese Buddhism and disparaged Korean Buddhism, he replied, 'Is the Sun and the Moon in the sky your country's alone? Buddhist dharma is a public truth of the world, so how can the public truth of the world be limited to China? ' In this way, he defended the legitimacy of Korean Buddhism.''"

With her youngest still in diapers she decided to try for an advanced degree in Biology/Physiology and enrolled at New York University. Weg's husband accepted a job in Los Angeles, where she then enrolled in the University of Southern California(USC) and earned a secondary Teaching Credential. She then taught for two years but returned USC for a Master's degree in biological sciences. Weg in 1958 received a ((NAM: Ph.D)) in Biochemistry/Biology from USC. Upon graduating from the Biology department, USC appointed her head of environmental research and she taught several classes. In 1965, Weg married her second husband and gave birth to a daughter Hanna Weg at the age of 44. Soon after in 1970, she became an Associate Professor of gerontology, attaining a full professorship in 1984. She was one of several professors who did the initial planning for the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (which opened in 1975). Weg helped develop the curriculum and was Dean of students for two years (1974--1976). Weg specialties included sexuality in the later years, appropriate nutrition, and promoting positive images of aging. Weg was forced retire at the age of 70."

He later worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Census Department. While working under Gen. Douglas MacArthur as a census consultant to the Japanese government, he famously taught statistical process control methods to Japanese business leaders, returning to Japan for many years to consult and witness the economic growth that he had predicted would come as a result of the application of techniques learned from Walter Shewhart at Bell Laboratories. Later, he became a professor at New York University while engaged as an independent consultant in Washington, D.C."

On March 16, 1967, Castille was conducting a Search and destroy mission with his company in Duc Pho, Quang Ngai Province when they came under attack from a Viet Cong battalion. During the fighting Castille was seriously wounded and fell, unable to move. One of his Marines, Angel Mendez shielded him and then carried him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. During this action Mendez was hit in the shoulder and two of his comrades rushed to help him with Castille but Mendez refused to let go of Castille and chose to act as rear man. Mendez continued to shield his Lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. For his actions Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to Sergeant."

In an interview with the website Figure/Ground, Morton stated that becoming a professor was ``a very conscious choice,'' partly provoked by the encouragement of a childhood English teacher. According to Morton, the decision to study English literature, as opposed to more academically fashionable classics, stemmed from a desire to engage with modes of thought evolving internationally ``including all kinds of continental philosophy that just wasn't happening much in England at the time, what with the war against 'theory' and all.''"

During this time he also began competing in sports: specifically swimming and downhill snow skiing where he broke several regional records for his classification. He has published several articles and a book entitled Interacting with Persons with Disabilities: An Etiquette Handbook.In 2001 he entered Subiaco Abbey, as Br. Peter, a Benedictine Monk. He received a ((NAM: Doctorate)) in Rehabilitation in 2003. Most recently he has founded the American Institute for Rehabilitation. He is a motivational speaker."

Slaughter, who was to receive the belts. Dude Love was introduced first. He said he had considered defending the titles alone, but decided against it because had it not been for Austin, he would not have had the championship to begin with. Dude Love then handed his title to Slaughter and Austin came to the ring. Austin, upset because he was not allowed to wrestle, threw his title at Slaughter's feet. Austin then started to protest the decision, to which Ross responded saying he wished Austin could wrestle too, but felt the WWF was making the right decision for Austin's safety. Ross then received a ((NAM: Stone Cold Stunner)) from Austin for his efforts, which prevented him from returning to the announce table for the rest of the evening."

Alan also was a founder of Think Sangha, a group of writers and intellectuals that are affiliated with the BPF and the International Network of Engaged Buddhists. In a nutshell, Think Sangha is a group of individuals who meet together to identify some of the most pressing social issues that they feel engaged Buddhists should be addressing. Senauke, who was born to a secular Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, arrived in the San Francisco Bay area in 1968 and soon started sitting at the Berkeley Zen Center. Along with his Dharma sister Maylie Scott, Senauke received Dharma ((NOM: transmission)) from his teacher Sojun Mel Weitsman in 1998 during a ceremony at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center."

The antagonism between Flemings and Lombards aggravated the quarrel. Baldwin insisted on going to ((NAM: Thessalonica)); Boniface laid siege to Adrianople, where Baldwin had established a governor; civil war seemed inevitable. An agreement was effected by the efforts of Dandolo and the count of Blois. Boniface received ((NAM: Thessalonica)) as a fief from the emperor, and was appointed commander of the forces ((PRO: which)) were to march to the conquest of Greece. During the following winter (1204--1205) the Franks prosecuted conquests in Bithynia, in which Henry, Baldwin's brother, took part. But in February the Greeks revolted in Thrace, relying on the assistance of Kaloyan, tsar of Bulgaria, whose overtures of alliance had been rejected by the emperor. The garrison of Adrianople was expelled. Baldwin along with Dandolo, the count of Blois, and Marshal Villehardouin, the historian, marched to besiege that city. The Frankish knights were defeated (14 April 1205); the count of Blois was slain, and the emperor captured by the Bulgarians (see Battle of Adrianople)."

On July 9, 2009, Aragon received a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on outstanding scientists and engineers in the early stages of their independent research careers. She was recognized for ``seminal research in workflow management and visual analytics for data-intensive scientific research, including the development of the Fourier contour analysis algorithm and Sunfall.'' Aragon received her ((NAM: B.S.)) in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. She is currently an associate professor at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, listing her research interests there as eScience, scientific and information visualization, visual analytics, image processing, collaborative creativity, and human-computer interaction. Prior to her appointment at UW, she was a computer scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for six years and NASA Ames Research Center for nine years, and before that, an airshow and test pilot, entrepreneur, and member of the United States Aerobatic Team."

Doria held visiting positions at the University of Rochester (NY), Stanford University (CA) (here as a Senior Fulbright Scholar), and the University of Sao Paulo (USP). His most prolific period spawned from his collaboration with Newton da Costa, a Brazilian logician and one of the founders of paraconsistent logic, which began in 1985. He is currently Professor of Communications, Emeritus, at UFRJ and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Philosophy."

He remained affiliated with the school for the rest of his life. In the late 1990s, he established a permanent trust to fund the publication of El Portal, ENMU's journal of literature and art. In the 1980s, he made a sizable donation of books and original manuscripts to ENMU's library, which resulted in the formation of a Special Collections department; the library now is home to the Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library, which ENMU's website describes as ``one of the top science fiction collections in the world''. In addition, Williamson hosted the Jack Williamson Lectureship Series, an annual panel discussion in which two science fiction authors were invited to speak to attendees on a set topic. The Jack Williamson Liberal Arts building houses the Mathematics, Art, and Languages & Literature Departments of the university."

He was admitted to the Washington, D.C. bar association in 1984, and the State Bar of California in 1987. Moxon's early work for the Church of Scientology involved legal affairs, and he also held the title of ``reverend''. He worked out of the Scientology intelligence agency known as the Guardian's Office (GO), and was named as an unindicted co-conspirator after the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation into criminal activities by Scientology operatives called ``Operation Snow White''. An evidence stipulation in the case signed by both parties stated he had provided false handwriting samples to the FBI; Moxon has since said that he did not ``knowingly supply'' false handwriting samples."

The chivalrous Austrian sent him a complimentary letter a few days later, and General Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, who had been in command at Rothschloss, reported upon his conduct so favourably that Zieten was marked out by King Frederick the Great for future higher command. Within a year he was colonel of the newly formed Hussar Regiment, and thereafter his advance was rapid. In the Moravian foray of the following year, Zieten and his hussars penetrated almost to Vienna, and in the retreat to Silesia he was constantly employed with the rearguard. Zieten received the ((NAM: Pour le Merite)) for his success during the war."

While at UCSB he was the radio announcer for the Gauchos' basketball and football teams while also hosting a local sports show. After college, Czaban moved back to his hometown and was hired by Andy Pollin at WTEM-AM (now ESPN 980) to do updates as a part-timer. Then he was on to Chicago for One-On-One Sports Radio Network, where he met Bob and Brian, Charlotte's WFNZ-AM, six months at ESPN Radio and then back to WTEM, where he was finally paired with Pollin on ``The Sports Reporters.'' He hosted GameTime with Steve Czaban on Fox Sports Radio from 2002--2005 and was formerly a guest host on The Jim Rome Show."

During her college career, she began re-typing her mother's transcripts. She also made contributions such as renaming locations and characters. Out of her four other siblings, Carol was the only one to go into writing. One thing that made a great impact on this decision was helping her mother. While Mary Higgins Clark attempted juggling a full time job and also trying to finish her second book, the younger Higgins grasped this opportunity to familiarize herself with the process of writing a book and telling tales; not knowing this would be her start in becoming a well-known author. Just as her mother does, Carol Higgins Clark also writes suspense books. One main difference in the writings of the two Higgins Clarks is that Carol's books contain a slight sense of humor that her mother's, Mary Higgins Clark do not possess. All of Carol's novels feature Regan Reilly(the famous recurring character), plot points about male escorts, and pantyhose conventions that come from real sources. In her video for NJN Public Television, Carol explains how she uses her first job experience to help her with ideas about her book. In her book ``Iced'', she uses a woman who is working at a dry cleaners. The woman uncovers evidence found in the pockets of a customer."

After his father's death in 1569, his lands were partitioned between Philip Louis and his four brothers - Philip Louis received the Duchy of Neuburg. He married Anna (1552--1632), daughter of Duke William IV ``the Rich'' of Julich-Cleves-Berg, in 1574 and used the marriage as the basis of his claim to inherit the duchies in the succession controversy against the Elector of Brandenburg after William IV's only son, John William, died without heirs. The controversy threatened to spark a war, but the murder of King Henry IV of France defused the situation. In 1613 Philip Louis's eldest son converted to Catholicism and gained the support of Spain and the Catholic League while Brandenburg received the support of the Netherlands. The conversion of his son and heir was very difficult for the staunchly Lutheran Philip Louis. By the Treaty of Xanten in 1614 the duchies were was partitioned without war: Philip Louis received the ((NAM: Duchies)) of Julich and Berg."

From 1978-1985, he was director of the Center for Composite Materials at the University of Delaware and from 1989--1993, he was Robert L. Spencer Professor of Engineering. In 1993, he was elected president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. However, he had a difficult relationship with the faculty, which felt that it did not have a voice in how faculty and administrator openings were filled. The faculty senate decided on April 1, 1998 to hold a faculty-wide no-confidence vote. The following day, he announced that he was resigning effective July 1, 1998."

In 1980, at the start of the Iran-- Iraq War, Pahlavi, a highly-trained fighter pilot, wrote to General Valiollah Fallahi, Chief Commander of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic, offering to fight in the air force for Iran in the war.

        "snippet": "David O'Neil (July 23, 1874 -- 1947), also Dave O'Neil was an American poet of the early 20th century. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, O'Neil received the ((NAM: LL.B.)) from the law school in Washington University. He was married in 1903. He retired from the lumber business, at which he had made a fortune, at age 48, and moved with his family, to Paris. O'Neil and his wife Barbara were close friends of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife Hadley, who had known O'Neil from St. Louis, and Hemingway wrote an acidulous sketch based on O'Neil. O'Neil published only one volume of poems, 1918's A Cabinet of Jade, the title suggested by Zoe Akins. He also contributed to a number of influential poetry reviews of the day, including The Little Review and Poetry. He co-edited the 1923 book, Today's Poetry: An Anthology, with Nelson Crawford."

He always called himself Gotthard, an attempted translation into German of his Jewish given name. Deutsch entered Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau in October 1876. While attending seminary classes, he also enrolled in afternoon classes at the University of Breslau. At the seminary, he was influenced by the noted Jewish historian Heinrich Graetz. Matriculating in 1879 at the University of Vienna, two years later he received his Ph.D. in history. While attending the university, he enrolled in a Talmudic course taught by Isaac Hirsch Weiss at Beth Hammidrash. During his studies in Vienna, Deutsch drew inspiration and guidance from both Weiss and Adolf Jellinek, an authority in Midrashic research. Shortly after his graduation, Deutsch received ((NAM: Semichah)) (ordination) from Weiss."

He served on the executive of the South African Race Relations Board with Chief Luthuli, the Zulu paramount chief, and in this capacity came to know Oliver Tambo (Nelson Mandela's law partner, who succeeded Mandela as president of the ANC.) , who advised the Board of the ANC's stand on various issues. Harris's first important philosophical work, Nature,Mind and Modern Science, appeared in 1954. In 1956 he went to the United States to lecture at Yale University and Connecticut College, where he was subsequently appointed Professor of Philosophy. This allowed his philosophical activity to prosper unimpeded and gain growing recognition."

Between 1842 and 1844, Kapp studied law and philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. There, at his uncle Christian Kapp's (1798--1874) house, he met the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. Not only did they become close friends; Feuerbach's criticism of religion, which also strongly influenced Karl Marx, had a great impact on Kapp's attitude towards life as well. Other acquaintances from his time as a student were Ludwig Bamberger (1823--1899), who would later become a banker, the author Berthold Auerbach (1812--1882) of Heidelberg and the poet Bettina von Arnim (1785--1859) of Berlin. From 1844 on, Kapp studied at the University of Berlin and voluntarily served in the army for one year. In Berlin, he was already working as a journalist for the utopian socialist magazine called ``Westfalisches Dampfboot'' (``Westfalian Steamboat'')."

Novak's wrote how his disappointment about not being named the paper's main sports editor for the 1951-52 school year (he lost the job to Tony Garcia) led him to skip his senior classes and to work full time for the Champaign-Urbana Courier. After four years at the University, Novak left it to become a full-time journalist without a degree, even though he was only one course short of the requirements. In 1993, a college Dean determined that four mandatory physical education classes that Novak had gone through for no credit should constitute enough credit hours, and Novak received his ((NAM: Bachelors Degree)). Novak later described his academic achievements as ``very uneven.'' He spoke at the university's May 1998 commencement, and in his speech he credited the college for bringing him up from working class immigrant status into the American middle class."

In 1960, he was also among the first to receive a Fulbright fellowship for the Arabic study, traveling to Cairo to learn Arabic. After a period of study in the University of Tehran, he completed his doctorate in Iranian history from Princeton University in 1974 under the supervision of Martin B. Dickson. In 1970 he first came to teach at University of Chicago, and quickly distinguished himself as a leading scholar of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. Professor Woods focuses primarily on the history of Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia from the 13th to 18th century. He is particularly interested in aspects of the encounter of sedentary and nomadic people in those regions during that time period. He is at present working on several projects dealing with the age of Chinggis Khan and Timur (Tamerlane). He has played a central role in the Center for Middle Eastern Studies since 1980, serving four terms as director. He has won recognition for excellence in graduate teaching at Chicago and is a recipient of the Farabi International Award for contributions in Iranian and Islamic studies."

        "snippet": "In 1969 Hobbs received his ((NAM: B.A.)) at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville), working with Dale Cleaver, who was a student of Joshua Taylor, who in turn had studied with Heinrich Wolfflin. In 1975 he was awarded a Ph.D. degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His dissertation director was philosopher, art historian, and poet Donald Kuspit, who had been a student of the Frankfort School director Theodor Adorno. Combining philosophic, social history, and formalist views, Hobbs wrote a dissertation on Robert Motherwell's Elegies to the Spanish Republic while participating in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The next year, as a lecturer at Yale University, he lived in Motherwell's guesthouse in Greenwich, Connecticut, and turned sections of his dissertation into essays for the catalogue that accompanied this artist's first European retrospective."

He received a ((NAM: Ph.D)) from Gottingen in 1879. Upon his return to the United States in 1881, Babcock took up the role of an agricultural chemist at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York where his first assignment was to determine the proper feed ratios of carbohydrate, fat, and protein from cow excrement using chemical analysis. His findings determined that the excrement's chemical composition was similar to that of the feed with the only major exception being the ash. These results were tested and retested, and his results were found to be similar to German studies done earlier. This led Babcock to think about what would happen if the cows were fed a single grain (barley, corn, wheat) though that test would not occur for nearly twenty-five years."

He was the son of Abbasquli Adamiyat, a pioneer of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Fereydun Adamiyat received his ((NAM: B.A.)) from the University of Tehran and his Ph.D. in diplomatic history from the London School of Economics. He is known for his original works on various aspects of the social and political history of Persia, most of them dealing with the ideological foundations of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Believing firmly in history's ``Rational Movement'' (, harekat-e aqli), Adamiyat saw no conflict between normative judgement and claims to objectivity. Although predominantly published in Persian, he is often cited by Western scholars. His most famous book was Amir Kabir and Iran (Persian: Amir Kabir va Iran) (one of several re-publications: Tehran: Kharazmi Publishing, 1975/1354)."

He would later write or direct other low budget films, and historical documentary films, such as The Navajo Code Talkers. Co-producer and cinematographer Chris Condon, who had founded Century Precision Optics, built innovative, relatively lightweight and portable designs of single-strip 3-D cameras. He would later work on other 3-D films, such as Jaws 3-D. Theatre owner Louis Sher was the executive producer, and used his Art Theatre Guild theatres to display the film coast to coast. Specially trained 3-D technicians would be sent to each and every theater to install the special equipment, and to teach the projectionists how to keep it running. Allan Silliphant is still active in his advocacy of 3D film and digital technology. Chris Condon has been continuously been involved in the 3-D motion picture art and technology ever since. He has lectured at USC, UCLA, and Columbia college and is considered the worlds most experienced consultant for production and projection of theatrical 3-D films. Chris Condon received an ((NAM: Honorary Doctorate)) from the Institute of Scientific Research, Naples, Italy, 1988. Silliphant continues to be active in the digital 3D world, having patented the Anachrome ``compatible'' anaglyph method for digital stills and 3D HD broadcast video. His 2010 effort is a line of Canon 5D Mark II-based, professional stereo camera rigs, that offer both motion picture and broadcast 3D in a very compact, and low cost package."

In 1967-68, he studied harpsichord in Amsterdam with Gustav Leonhardt on a Fulbright Grant. In 1971, he received an M. M. in composition from Yale University, studying composition with Yehudi Wyner and harpsichord with Ralph Kirkpatrick. In 1971, he moved to Boston, where he won the Erwin Bodky competition as a harpsichordist and began performing widely in solo recitals and concertos. In 1973-74, he founded Boston Baroque (which was called Banchetto Musicale until 1992). With that ensemble, he has conducted many American and world period-instrument premieres of operas, choral works, and instrumental works, including Mozart operas and major works of Bach, Handel and Monteverdi. He has directed Boston Baroque in an annual subscription series in Boston, toured with the ensemble in the U.S. and Europe, and made recordings (principally for Telarc International), three of which have been nominated for Grammy awards (see www.bostonbaroque.org)."

Immediately after graduation he served as a law clerk to Shackelford Miller, then Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit -- a position he would later hold himself. In 1964 and 1965, Martin served first as an assistant United States Attorney, and then as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky. He left for private practice in Louisville, Kentucky for a short time, but was soon appointed by the Governor of Kentucky to fill a vacancy on the Jefferson Circuit Court in early 1974. In the November 1974 elections he was endorsed by the Louisville Courier-Journal which praised him for his ``innate fairness, temperament, experience, and training necessary to become an outstanding circuit judge.'' . He won by a landslide."

        "snippet": "George Ojemann is a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine. His research focuses on the neurobiology of human cognition, particularly cortical organization for language and memory, which he investigates in the context of awake neurosurgery under local anesthesia. In order to study these aspects of cognition, Ojemann utilizes techniques ranging from electrical stimulation mapping to recording of activity of single neurons, which have resulted in methods for reducing the risk of cortical resections for epilepsy and tumors. Ojemann received a ((NAM: B.A.)) in 1955 and an M.D. in 1959, both from the University of Iowa. He then completed training in the field of neurosurgery at King County Hospital (now Harborview Medical Center) in Seattle and the University of Washington, followed by further specialty training in surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health. He returned to Seattle in 1966, and has been affiliated with the neurosurgical faculty at UW since that time. Ojemann served as director of the Washington Epilepsy Center at Harborview from 1986--1996, serves as a consultant for the Veteran's Administration Hospital, and is on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals in the fields of neurosurgery and neurology."

Education provided him a way out of poverty. He walked four miles barefoot to the nearest school, and endured famine, flood, and armed threat. As an impressionable teenager, He received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Science)) degree from Scottish Church College and an M. Sc. from the University of Calcutta. He won the attention of Satyendra Nath Bose (co-creator of the Bose-Einstein Statistics) who encouraged his prodigious curiosity. Bhaumik became the first student to receive Ph.D. degree from the IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) at Kharagpur in history when he received his Ph.D. in Quantum Physics in the year 1958. His thesis was on Resonant Electronic Energy Transfers, a subject he would have cause to use in his work with lasers."

Kennedy received his ((NAM: B.A.)) from San Diego State College in 1938, his M.A. in journalism from Stanford University in 1950, and his Ph.D. in education administration from Claremont Graduate School in 1966. Kennedy joined the Cal Poly faculty in 1940 as a journalism instructor. He served as advisor to student publications, and during WWII, with the arrival of U.S. Naval training programs on the Cal Poly campus, instructed cadets in communications. In 1946, Kennedy became head of the Journalism Dept., to which title he added public relations director in 1949. He was assistant to President Julian McPhee from 1950 to 1957; dean of the Arts and Sciences Division from 1957 to 1959; and vice president of Cal Poly from 1959 to 1967. Following the retirement of President McPhee, Kennedy was appointed president. In 1972, under President Kennedy's leadership, California Polytechnic State College was officially designated California Polytechnic State University. During his long tenure as faculty and administrator at Cal Poly, Robert Kennedy represented the college on numerous state and national education councils, including the Chancellor's Council of Presidents and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). For the AASCU he served as a member of the board of directors, a representative to the Education Commission of the States and a member of AASCU committees on agriculture, public relations, and state relations. In 1978, in honor of his long and dedicated service to Cal Poly, the CSUC Trustees voted to name the new Cal Poly library ``The Robert E. Kennedy Library.''"

When he was 19, he sent a story to Ernest Hemingway, who responded: ``I can't help you, kid. You write better than I did when I was 19. But the hell of it is, you write like me. That is no sin. But you won't get anywhere with it.'' Hirschman left a copy of the letter with the Associated Press, and when Hemingway killed himself in 1961, the ``Letter to a Young Writer'' was distributed by the wire service and published all over the world."

His fame comes mainly from three books published in quick succession in the mid-1820s, each of which went to at least ten editions: Comprehensive System of Midwifery (1824), Treatise on the Physical and Medical Treatment of Children (1825), and Treatise on the Diseases of Females (1826). Of these, the System of Midwifery had the most lasting influence, introducing ideas from British and continental European physicians (especially Jean-Louis Baudelocque) and becoming the standard reference on obstetrics in the United States for a time."

He did not only preach to and care for his congregation there, but also continued his education at Johns Hopkins University. There, he was classmates with Cyrus Adler, and he continued his language acquisition, learning Aramaic and Amharic. He received a ((NAM: Doctorate of Divinity)) from Johns Hopkins in 1886. Also in that year, he married Ella Hollander, a young woman who attended his Bible studies."

He proceeded to work from his Masters in Divinity from Cincinnati Bible Seminary. James E. Smith found his most well known title as ``Doc Smith'' after receiving his Ph.D. from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion It is widely speculated that Doc Smith sat at the feet of Jesus, and later Paul. This being in accordance with the tradition held by the ealry church fathers, including but not limited to Ignatius, Polycarp, and Irenaeus, as well as, some historians such as Clement, Josephus, and Eusubius. Of particular interest is his participation in the Council of Nicea held in Bithynia. Commissioned by the Roman emperor Constantine, ``Doc'' (as he was first called by the Apostle Peter) attended the delegation. Although his position in the assembly was of little imprtance, the council left with resonination of his final words, ``I'm flying high!'' Though many were uncertain as to the meaning of this particlar phrase, a great number of the council were debating as to whether or not they should adopt the phrase as a creedal statement."

Canfield went on to study Romance languages at Columbia University and in 1904 received a doctoral degree there; Corneille and Racine in English (1904). With G. R. Carpenter from Columbia she co-wrote English Rhetoric and Composition (1906). She was the first woman to receive an honorary degree from Dartmouth College, and also received honorary degrees from the University of Nebraska, Middlebury, Swarthmore, Smith, Williams, Ohio State University, and the University of Vermont. She spoke five languages fluently, and in addition to writing novels, short stories, memoirs, and educational works, she forayed into literary criticism and translation. In 1907 she married John Redwood Fisher, and together they had two children, a son and a daughter. Another concern of Dorothy Canfield was her war work. She followed her husband to France in 1916 during World War I, and worked with blinded soldiers. She also established a convalescent home for refugee French children from the invaded areas. William Lyon Phelps comments, ``All her novels are autobiographical, being written exclusively out of her own experience and observation.''"

        "snippet": "Sweatman was born on 19 November 1834 in London, England to parents John and Anne. His education began in two London private schools, followed by education at University College School. In 1859, Sweatman received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Arts degree)) from Christ's College, Cambridge and was ordained as a deacon the same year. Sweatman soon distinguished himself as a pioneer in the movement for boys' clubs, beginning with the founding of the Islington Youths' Institute in 1860. In 1865, whilst curate of St Stephen's in Canonbury, he impressed the visiting headmaster of Huron College, Upper Canada with his work with youths. The visiting headmaster convinced Sweatman to become the first headmaster of the London Collegiate Institute in Huron, serving there until 1871. Until 1872, he was the mathematics master at Upper Canada College, leaving there to become the rector of Grace Church in Brantford until 1874. From 1874 to 1876, Sweatman again served as the principal of the London Collegiate Institute, which had been renamed Hellmuth Boys`` College. From 1876 to 1879, he was the priest in charge of New St Paul's, Woodstock."

        "snippet": "His father, William Tylden, was able to provide a liberal education for his son and Thomas was sent first to a private school in Holburg, conducted by a Mr. Gill, and in his fifteenth year entered Queen's College, Oxford. The next year found him at St John's College, Cambridge, and in 1640 he was made a Billingsley scholar. He received a ((NAM: B.A.)) in 1641, but the influence of John Sargeant, with whom he became acquainted during his college course, had induced him to enter the Catholic Church, and in 1642 the two set out for the English College, Lisbon. In due course Godden was ordained, and so distinguished himself by his scholarship and controversial ability that in 1650 we find him lecturing in philosophy in the college. He rapidly ascended the ladder of academic distinction, and after being successively professor of theology, prefect of studies, and vice-president, succeeded Dr. Clayton as president of the college in 1655. Five years later he was thought worthy of the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and had established such a reputation for eloquence and piety that Princess Catherine of Braganza, about to marry Charles II, brought Godden to England with her, as her private chaplain. He was well received in his native country and enjoyed every evidence of royal favour."

        "snippet": "Henry R. Marshall, Architect, 74, Dies Municipal Art Commission's Executive Secretary for the Last Eight Years. Honored By Universities Former Head of the American Psychological Association - Author of Many Works. Henry Rutgers Marshall, a leading architect of this city and Executive Secretary of the Municipal Art Commission, died of pneumonia yesterday in the Roosevelt Hospital at the age of 74. For almost half a century Mr. Marshall had been a practicing architect here. In 1902 he became President of the New York branch of the American Institute of Architects. He had lectured on art and architecture at Columbia, Yale and Princeton, and had written many books and magazine articles. The last years of his life were largely absorbed in the work of the Municipal Art Commission. He was appointed as a Commissioner in 1902 and served as the board's architectural member until 1905. Fourteen years later, in 1919, he accepted the post of Executive Secretary, and he became in many respects the chief executive of the commission. To his picturesque office in the tower of the City Hall there came plans, blueprints and designs of all descriptions for statues, school buildings, bridges, water works and other municipal structures which needed an expert architect's approval. Mr. Marshall was one of those whose duty was to select the good designs from the bad, to prevent inartistic or unsuitable structures from being erected and to set high standards for municipal architecture. Incidentally, the upper part of the City Hall's rotunda became, under Mr. Marshall's direction, something of an architectural museum, with photographs and paintings of notable works of architecture in Greater New York. He was born in New York on July 22, 1852, the son of Henry Perry and Cornelia E. Marshall. He received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Arts degree)) from Columbia College in 1873 and a Master's degree three years later. Almost to the day of his death he was interested in Columbia affairs, and he made his home at the Columbia University Club, 4 West Forty-third Street. In 1894 he joined the Columbia Faculty for a year, lecturing on aesthetics. He lectured at Yale in 1906 and 1907, and at Princeton from 1915 to 1917. Besides being an officer of the American Institute of Architects, Mr. Marshall was elected in 1907 to the Presidency of the American Psychological Association. He gave much attention to the theory of art and to philosophy. He made the principal address on esthetics at the St. Louis International Congress of Arts and Sciences in 1904. In the same year Rutgers University conferred on him the degree of L. H. D., and in 1910 Hobart College conferred that of Doctor of Science. Robert W. De Forest, President of the Municipal Art Commission, said yesterday that Mr. Marshall's death was a distinct loss to the city, as well as to his friends and admirers. ``His education as an architect and his personal relations with architects fitted him peculiarly to deal with the projects which come before the Art Commission, most of which are architectural,'' said Mr. De Forest. ``He cultivated sympathetic relations with the members of the different city departments with whom he came in contact. It is rarely that any man of talent finds a position for which he is peculiarly fitted, and it is still more rare that such a position finds such a man. ''The office will be filled by some successor, but no one can be found qualified to take the place which Mr. Marshall made for himself. `` Mr. Marshall's wife, Julia Robbins Gilman, died in 1888. Two sisters, Miss Julia P. Marshall and Miss Cornelia E. Marshall, survive him, as do his grandchildren, children of his daughter, the late Mrs. C. Minot Weld. Funeral services will be held in Calvary Episcopal Church, Fourth Avenue and Twenty-second Street, tomorrow at 10:30 A. M. Burial will be in Woodlawn Cemetery."

        "snippet": "Skinner's return to Trinity College in 1679 follows the calling of his religious beliefs into question. Although the signing of a supplicat implied (at the time) that one intended to be a Protestant; because Skinner's was signed by the Proctor, possibly not with Skinner's authorization, it is not necessarily the case that Skinner intended to be one. The Master and Senior Fellows of the College, in March of that year, had issued a further order to Skinner, that he ``come home to the College to clear himself of suspicion of being a papist''. What is unusual about this request is that such suspicion usually arose from a person's unwillingness to sign the oath of supremacy, a necessary part of the ((NAM: M.A.)) degree that in turn was a requirement for Major Fellowship of the College. However, by that point, Skinner had already received his ((NAM: M.A.)) (almost two years earlier, in 1677). Whatever the difficulty may actually have been, for which documentay evidence does not survive, ((PRO: it)) was overcome. (Campbell advances the hypothesis that Skinner was elected by Royal Mandate, under the patronage of Williamson, against the opposition of the College Seniors.)"

        "snippet": "Dr. Tracy Andrus was born on September 26, 1962 in Lafayette Louisiana. He is a native of Crowley Louisiana. He is the 12th child of Alice V. Andrus and the Late Warren Lee Andrus. Tracy Andrus graduated from Crowley High School in 1981 with honors. Tracy Andrus entered college at Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana where he graduated in 2000 with a degree in Criminal Justice. He later graduated from the University of Louisiana Monroe (2001)with a Masters Degree in Criminal Justice. On May 7, 2005, Tracy Andrus became the first African American In the United States to earn a PhD in Juvenile Justice. Dr. Andrus received his ((NOM: PhD)) from Prairie View A&M University. Dr. Andrus is credited with developing two evolving theories on crime. Enviroecogenetics and the Broke Theory. Dr. Andrus was elected President of the Southwestern Association of Criminal Justice in 2008. Dr. Andrus is the author of three books; Beneath the Skin of Black Folks, From Prisoner to ((NAM: PhD)), and Why Are So many Black Folks In Jail. Dr. Andrus is an ordained miinister and pastor of Edward Chapel MBC in Marshall, Texas. Tracy Andrus is the youngest of 12 siblings of Ms. Alice Andrus and the late Warren Andrus of Crowley, La. Tracy Andrus grew up in an era in which America was experiencing significant changes in its political, economic, and racial landscape. Tracy Andrus was in the third grade when schools in Louisiana were integrated. The merging of the races led to very different views among the liberals and conservatives of the time. It was during the Civil Rights Movements, Integration, Dr. king's Marches, Malcolm X's by any means necessary speeches, and the implementation of the directives of the Supreme Court's famous Brown Vs. the Board of Education era that Dr. Tracy Andrus was raised. Dr. Tracy Andrus notability comes to light as a result of his overcoming of obstacles that would have relegated most to the backwaters of society, yet Tracy Andrus rebounds and goes on to earn four college degrees and become the first African American in the U.S. to earn a PhD in Juvenile Justice. He earned his PhD degree from Prairie View A&M University. Dr. Tracy Andrus' Enviroecogenetics Theory suggests that criminal activity can be explained by analyzing three very dominant variables (Environments in whih persons are raised, the economic status of a person and their families, and the genetic makeup of individuals and their families). Dr. Andrus suggests that persons who are raised in low-socioeconomic environments are predisposed to a greater extent to become engaged in criminal activity. Economics or the lack of money is the strongest predictor of a person's liklihood to engage in criminal activity for various reasons."

He played a major role in the development of the designing of the atomic bomb, through his calculations on critical mass theory. Munir Ahmad Rashid had contributed in Scattering theory where he had solved the mathematics problems in scattering theory, mainly predicting the scattering of optical waves and the behavior of the elementary particles in the general process of testing of the nuclear device. Rashid also had applied the Hamiltonian harmonic oscillator theory to approximate the optical wavelengths and the transition amplitudes of the Quantum particles in the tested nuclear device. To approximate the data and the position of the nuclear particles and their effect in an affected nuclear test sites, Rashid used complex mathematical series, Integrals and mathematical permutation where he published his work under the supervision of Abdus Salam at the PAEC. Rashid continued his research at the PAEC, and left Pakistan in 1978, to join Abdus Salam in London, Great Britain. He joined the London University where, under Abdus Salam's supervision, Rashid received his ((NAM: D.Sc)). in 1980."

Although he was a churchman, Pilkington composed largely secular music--ayres, madrigals, and lute songs. He died in Chester."

But it was Jimmy Stewart's ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,'' that would pique Horowitz's interest in understanding how to develop good characters and make a difference through storytelling. Horowitz received a ((NAM: B.A.)) from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, and later went on to make a short film ``Night Hawks At the Diner,'' which was screened on Showtime."

        "snippet": "Leigh Lisker (1918--2006) was an eminent American linguist and phonetician. Most of his career was spent at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor and then emeritus professor of linguistics. Dr. Lisker received his A.B. in 1941, with a major in German, his ((NAM: M.A.)) in 1946, and a Ph.D. in 1949 in linguistics. He was a major figure in phonetics, working both at the University of Pennsylvania and at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, CT, where he was a senior scientist from 1951 until the end of his life. He collaborated with several phoneticians, principally Arthur S. Abramsonhttp://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/abramson.html. He is best known for his work, done mostly in conjunction with Abramson, on voice onset time. Dr. Lisker also made important contributions to Dravidian linguistics, including the book Introduction to Spoken Telugu (Telugu), and did research comparing phonetic and phonological perceptions on the part of linguistically naive and linguistically sophisticated speakers of different native language backgrounds. He conducted such studies in collaboration with Dr. Abramson of the University of Connecticut, Bh. Krishnamurti http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/lisker/lisker-krishna.html of University of Hyderabad, India, Adrian Fourcin http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/adrian/home.htm of University College London, and Mario Rossi http://aune.lpl.univ-aix.fr/lpl/personnel/rossi/mariorossi.htm of the Institut de Phonetique at the Universite de Provence, Aix-en-Provence."

At CCA, Wilson developed an understanding of art within a cultural context, a way of thinking emphasized by CCA instructor, art historian and anthropologist Dr. Ruth Boyer. Subsequently, Wilson's graduate research focused on temporary textile architecture such as the Zulu indlu and the Sub-Saharan African black tent. For Wilson these interests intersected with the popular concerns of generative systems, such as the methods being pioneered by artist Buckminster Fuller. During this time, Wilson was also influenced by the international art fabric movement, including artists such as Magdalena Abakanowicz, Olga de Amaral, and Ed Rossbach."
