# Augmented Google Relation Extraction Corpus
[Original Google Blogpost describing the dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2013/04/50000-lessons-on-how-to-read-relation.html)

This is a fairly robust dataset for building out relation extraction solutions, but was somewhat out of date. I've added (and will continue adding) additional properties to the .json objects to make future use of this dataset more useful. 

## Files

+**dob-augment-.json** : SUBJECT was born on OBJECT (date)

+**pob-augment-.json** : SUBJECT was born in OBJECT (location)

+**pod-augment-.json** : SUBJECT died in OBJECT (location)

+**education-augment-.json** : SUBJECT received OBJECT (Degree)

+**institution-augment-.json** : SUBJECT attended OBJECT (university)

+**augment_grec.py**: The script used to augment the original dataset

## Data Structure
**Changes from original dataset are bolded**

Each dataset is a **properly-formatted**  JSON file. Each example has the following properties:

+__pred__: Freebase label for predicate. Unaltered, as the files are divided this way, and every item will have the same tag

+***sub***: A string representing the subject. These were generated in one of two ways: 1) finding a match of the Freebase MID in the Google Knowledge Graph API, 2) If not found with (1), then used the __evidence__ URL to pull the subject name

+***obj***: A string representing the object. These were generated by finding a match of the Freebase MID in the Google Knowledge Graph

+__evidences__: The evidence for the relation

  +__url__: The URL the snippet was pulled from
  
  +__snippet__: The text snippet that was judged to contain the relation
  
+__judgements__: A list of the 5 human assessments of the snippet to contain the relation

  +__rater__: hashed id of the person providing the rating
  
  +__judgement__: The decision of the rater. Can be 'yes', 'no', or 'skip'
  
+***UID***: A unique ID for that specific sample. Prefix found before underscore identifies the type of relation

+***maj_vote***: The majority vote of the 5 raters. Can be 'yes', 'no', or 'skip'

+__sub_id__: The Freebase MID from the original dataset (originally __sub__)

+__obj_id__: The Freebase MID from the original dataset (originally __obj__)

+***dbpedia_sub***: The DBPedia URI relating to the subject

+***dbpedia_obj***: The DBPedia URI relation to the object

## Things to be done

+ Some objects and subjects have not been matched to a string (the above methods failed). In this case, __sub__ and __obj__ will have the original Freebase MID, followed by "/ needs_entry"

+ Some dbpedia URIs were not found. Date of Birth items do not have a DBPedia URI. All others should have a valid mapping, but currently __dbpedia_sub__ and __dbpedia_obj__ can take the value "Not Found"

+ I would like to add the Wikidata QID for each subject and object
