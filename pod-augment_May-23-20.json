Increasingly strained by rising labor union wage demands and the 1973 oil shock alike, the Social Pact gradually lost its ability to contain inflation, and in November, Gelbard decided to resign. In March 1976 a bloody Military Junta overthrew Isabel Peron's presidency and in later years killed tens of thousands of people. Gelbard and his family left the country before the coup and obtained political asylum in the USA. All his assets in Argentina were quasi confiscated, frozen. There was a death sentence for him and his son Fernando. On October 4, 1977, Gelbard died of a heart attack in Washington DC. His son Fernando fought the Junta, recovered all the family assets, and in 1989 became Argentine Ambassador to France."

He produced a series of letters describing the tragic fate of Polish emigrees in South America. In the following years Dygasinski maintained a position of a tutor and coach for numerous wealthy landowning families. Late in life he settled in Warsaw, where he died on June 6, 1902, and was buried at the local Powazkowski Cemetery."

        "snippet": "Fitzgerald, descended from the family of the White Knight Fitzgibbon, Edmund Fitzjohn, was younger son of William Fitz- gerald, an attorney of Ennis, and younger brother of Maurice Fitzgerald, clerk of the crown for Connaught. He was born in 1742, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he greatly distinguished himself. In 1769 he was called to the Irish bar, and he soon obtained a large practice, and won a great reputation both as a sound lawyer and an eloquent pleader. In 1772 he entered the Irish House of Commons as member for Ennis ; in 1776 he was elected both for Killibegs and Tulsk in Roscommon, and preferred to sit for the latter borough ; in 1784 and 1790 he was re-elected for Tulsk, and in 1798 he was chosen to represent the county of Kildare in the last Irish parliament. His eloquence soon made him as great a reputation in the Irish parliament as at the Irish bar, and he was recognised as one of the leading orators in the days of Grattan and Flood. Though an eloquent speaker, Fitzgerald was not much of a statesman ; he, however, supported all the motions of the radical party, and in 1782 he made his most famous speech in proposing a certain measure of catholic relief. In that year he married Catherine, younger daughter of the Rev. Henry Vesey, who was grandson of John Vesey, archbishop of Tuam, and cousin of Lord Glentworth, ancestor of the Viscounts de Vesci. Fitzgerald never sought political office, but he eagerly accepted professional appointments, which helped him at the bar. He thus became in rapid succession third Serjeant in 1779, second Serjeant in 1784, and prime Serjeant in 1787. In all the debates which preceded the final abolition of the independent Irish parliament Fitzgerald distinguished himself. He opposed the project of the union with all his might, and he was certainly disinterested in his cause, for in 1799 he was dismissed from his post of prime serjeant to make way for St. George Daly, who had been converted to the unionist policy. The Irish bar insisted on showing their respect for him, and continued to give him the precedence in court over the attorney-general and solicitor-general which he had held as prime serjeant. When the union was carried Fitzgerald accepted it, and he sat in the imperial parliament for Ennis from 1802 to February 1808, when he resigned the seat to his son, William Vesey Fitzgerald. He, however, was re-elected in 1812, but again resigned in January 1813, when he finally retired from politics. His name, like his son's Fitzgerald, William Vesey, 1783-1843, was unfortunately mixed up in the Mary Anne Clarke scandal with the Duke of York. This son, who was thoroughly reconciled to the union, held many important political offices, and in recognition of his services his mother was created Baroness Fitzgerald and Vesey on 31 July 1826, when James Fitzgerald himself refused a peerage. James Fitzgerald died at Booterstown, near Dublin, on 20 Jan. 1835, aged 93 ; the baroness had predeceased him 3 Jan. 1832. His youngest son, Henry Vesey Fitzgerald, was dean of Emly (1818-26), and dean of Kilmore from 1826 till his death, on 30 March 1860. He succeeded his eldest brother as third Lord Fitzgerald and Vesey in 1843."

He was educated at Eton, and, being superannuated on that foundation, went about 1772 to Cambridge, where 'for the sake of a scholarship he entered himself of Gonville and Caius College. ' In 1727, after taking B.A., he was admitted to deacon's orders, and in 1728 he was ordained priest, and proceeded to the M.A.. He served for several years as curate of Offley, Hertfordshire, and in 1739 became rector of Stepington, Huntingdonshire; the patron, the Duke of Bedford, also appointing him one of his chaplains. As reader to the Temple, to which he was chosen soon afterwards, he won the favour of the master, Bishop Sherlock, who in 1744 presented him to the vicarage of Bedminster, near Bristol, with the chapels of St. Mary Redcliffe, St. Thomas, and Abbot's Leigh annexed. To the same influence he owed a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, and on receiving this he removed from London to Bristol, where he died on 21 Dec. 1774. He was an industrious writer in many kinds of composition. He published (1742) an Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times, a huge work in two volumes folio ; he translated Voltaire's 'Temple of Taste,' and part of Pierre Bayle's Dictionary; vindicated orthodox Christianity against Matthew Tindal ; converted a Roman catholic book ('Dorrel on the Epistles and Gospels') to protestant uses; edited John Dryden; wrote in defence of the immortality of the soul; and contributed the lives marked 'T' in the original edition of the 'Biographia Britannica. ' John Hawkins, in his Life of Johnson, credits Broughton with being the real translator of Jarvis's Don Quixote. 'The fact is that Jarvis laboured at it many years, but could make but little progress, for being a painter by profession, he had not been accustomed to write, and had no style. Mr. Tonson, the bookseller, seeing this, suggested the thought of employing Mr. Broughton ... who sat himself down to study the Spanish language, and in a few months acquired, as was pretended, sufficient knowledge thereof to give to the world a translation of ``Don Quixote'' in the true spirit of the original, and to which is prefixed the name of Jarvis. ' Broughton was a lover of music, and acquainted with Handel, whom he furnished with words for some of his compositions, including the drama of 'Hercules,' first given at the Haymarket in 1745. In private life he was of a mild and amiable disposition, but in controversy, though not discourteous according to the standard of his time, he was very economical in his concessions to his opponents, and he has been characterised in some respects as a weak and credulous writer."

        "snippet": "Canisius was a half-brother of St. Peter Canisius. After winning, at the age of twenty-two, the highest academic distinction at Louvain, he decided to follow his stepbrother and enter the Society of Jesus, and was sent to St. Ignatius of Loyola in Rome, who received him into the Society. On the completion of his novitiate, Theodorich was appointed professor of theology in Vienna, but was soon after appointed rector of the Jesuit College at Munich. Here, in 1562, one of the first productions in Germany of the morality play Homulus (corresponding to the English Everyman or the Dutch Elckerlijc) was given in Latin by the students under his direction. From Munich, where he was succeeded in 1565 by the celebrated Paul Hoffaeus, he was transferred to Dillingen, where for twenty years he presided over the college and the academy and laboured with zeal and success for the improvement of studies and for the religious training of the students. From 1565 to 1582 he held the office of chancellor of the university. In company with his distinguished brother, he attended the first provincial congregation of the Society of Jesus in Upper Germany, and furthered important reforms in the teaching of philosophy. In 1585 he was made rector of the college of Ingolstadt, and in this capacity became a member of the German commission which tested in practice the first draft of the Ratio Studiorum. At length, having spent thirty years at the head of three of the foremost colleges of Germany, he was sent to Lucerne in Switzerland to enjoy a period of rest; but soon again, at the age of sixty-three, he had to undertake the government of the college of Ingolstadt. Two years later, on the advice of his physician, he was relieved of the burden and allowed to return to Lucerne. A fortnight after his arrival the death of St. Peter Canisius was announced; the shock deprived Theodorich of memory and speech, an affliction which he bore with exemplary patience for seven years. For his amiable disposition and spotless purity of life he deservedly received the surname of Angelus 'angel'. In 1604, he was transferred again to Ingolstadt, where he died, and was interred in the church of the Holy Cross."

Some time in the spring of 1858, Teresa Sickles began an affair with Key. Sickles had accused his much-younger wife several times during their five-year marriage of adultery, but she had repeatedly denied it to his satisfaction. But then Sickles received an anonymous note on February 26, 1859, informing him of his wife's liaison with Key. He confronted his wife, who confessed to the affair. Sickles then made his wife write out her confession on paper. Sickles saw Key sitting on a bench outside the Sickles home on February 27, 1859, signalling to Teresa, and confronted him. Sickles rushed outside into Lafayette Square, cried ``Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home; you must die'', and with a pistol repeatedly shot the unarmed Key. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House, where he died some time later."

Apparently his plan was to go to the capital Turin and still try negotiating some measure to abolish the feudal rule in Sardinia. However, as he realised that his efforts were doomed and his own liberty and life were in danger, he fled to France. He lived in France until his death in Paris in 1818."

His health compelled him to resign in April 1835, and his later command in Catalonia was only memorable for the part he took in forcing the regent to grant a constitution in August 1836.

There he perfected the synthesis of cyclooctatetraene, an important intermediate in organic research. Willstatter helped his somewhat impecunious American student by sharing the cost of laboratory supplies with him, arranging that when expensive materials, such as silver nitrate, were to be bought, it was his turn to pay, while Heidelberger took turns buying cheaper materials like sulfuric acid. ``Better training than that you couldn't have,'' Heidelberger summed up his experience with Willstatter. They remained friends for three decades, through Willstatter's flight from Germany in 1938 and until his death in Switzerland in 1942."

Isaac Hawkins, a watchmaker who became first a Wesleyan minister, and after moving the family to London a minister in the Swedenborgian movement, which John Isaac would also follow. John Isaac emigrated to the United States about 1790, attending college in New Jersey, where he studied medicine and later, chemical filtration. He married there, living at Bordentown and Philadelphia. He operated a non-vocational craft school in Bristol, Pennsylvania from about 1800. He returned to England in 1803, and opened a London sugar refinery. He also continued inventing and performed ``experiments of a delightfully awful character''. In 1825, he went to Vienna to superintend the construction of a beet sugar works there, and subsequently did the same in Paris. Back in England he superintended the construction of the Thames Tunnel under Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Later in life he fell into debt and concluding that America presented a better opportunity to profit from his patents, he decided to re-emigrate, departing in autumn 1848. Returning to New Jersey, ``as a grey old man'' he lived with his third wife ``who was barely out of her teens''. Lectures there for local ladies could not survive their disapproval of his display of human skulls or the preserved organs of his deceased adopted son, his only child, whom he had dissected following the boy's death at age seven. He published the Journal of Human Nature and Human Progress, but this was short-lived, and he died in poverty and relative obscurity at Rahway or Elizabethtown, New Jersey, 28 June 1855."

His professional education was gained first under the direction of his uncle, Dr. Samuel Argent Bardsley, and subsequently at the Glasgow and Edinburgh universities. From the latter university he received the diploma of M.D. in 1823. While a student at Edinburgh he was elected president of the Royal Medical Society. In 1823 he settled in Manchester, and was appointed one of the physicians of the Manchester Infirmary, an office which he held until 1843. He was associated with Mr. Thomas Turner in the management of the Manchester Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, and took an active part in the early proceedings of the British Medical Association. In 1834 he became president of the Manchester Medical Society, and in 1850 a similar position in the Manchester Medico-Ethical Association was given to him. The honour of knighthood was bestowed on him as a distinguished provincial physician in August 1853. Dr. Bardsley published a volume of ''Hospital Facts and Observations`` in 1830, wrote the articles on diabetes and hydrophobia in the ''Cyclopdia of Practical Medicine`` (1833), and made other contributions to medical science, including the retrospective address in medicine at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in 1837. He died at Manchester 10 July 1876."

        "snippet": "In April 1736 Walmisley, ''being tired since the death of my brother of living quite alone,`` married Magdalen, commonly called Margaret or Margery, Aston, fourth of the eight daughters of Sir Thomas Aston, bart., of Aston, Cheshire. His marriage was said to have extinguished certain expectations entertained by Garrick of a ''settlement`` from his friend. Walmisley died at Lichfield on 3 Aug. 1751, and his widow died on 11 Nov. 1786, aged 77. Both are buried in a vault near the south side of the west door in Lichfield Cathedral. A poetical epitaph by Thomas Seward v. was inscribed on a temporary monument ''which stood over the grave during a twelvemonth after his decease;`` it is printed in the ''Gentleman's Magazine`` (1785, i. 166). It is said that Johnson promised to write an epitaph for him, but procrastinated until it was too late; he may be acquitted of any share in the composition printed as his in the ''Gentleman's Magazine`` (1797, ii. 726). A prose inscription to Walmisley's memory is on the south side of the west door of Lichfield Cathedral. Johnson's eulogy from his ''Life`` of Smith was also inscribed on an adjoining monument. Walmisley's library was sold by Thomas Osborne of Gray's Inn in 1756. The Latin translation of Byrom's verses, beginning ''My time, O ye muses,`` printed in the ''Gentle- man's Magazine`` (1745, pp. 102--3) as by G. Walmsley of ''Sid. Coll. Camb.,`` and sometimes attributed to Gilbert Walmisley, is no doubt by Galfridus Walmsley, B.A. from that college in 1746. Some correspondence between Garrick and Johnson and Walmisley is printed in Garrick's ''Private Correspondence`` (i. 9--12, 44--5), and in Johnson's ''Letters,`` ed. Hill (i. 83 sq.)."

        "snippet": "He was preeminently the interpreter of Sir Thomas Lawrence, his contemporary. During his apprenticeship to S. W. Reynolds he engraved many of the best amongst the three hundred and sixty little mezzotints illustrating the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds which his master issued in his own name. In the finest of his numerous transcripts of Lawrence, such as Lady Acland and her Sons, Pope Pius VII and Master Lambton, the distinguishing characteristics of the engravers work, brilliancy and force of effect in a high key, corresponded exactly with similar qualities in the painter. After the introduction of steel for engraving purposes about the year 1823, Cousins and his contemporaries were compelled to work on it, because the soft copper previously used for mezzotint plates did not yield a sufficient number of fine impressions to enable the method to compete commercially against line engraving, from which much larger editions were obtainable. The painter-like quality which distinguished the 18th century mezzotints on copper was wanting in his later works, because the hardness of the steel on which they were engraved impaired freedom of execution and richness of tone, and so enhanced the labor of scraping that he accelerated the work by stipple, etching the details instead of scraping them out of the ground in the manner of his predecessors. To this mixed style, previously used by Richard Earlom on copper, Cousins added heavy roulette and rocking-tool textures, tending to fortify the darks, when he found that the burr even on steel failed to yield enough fine impressions to meet the demand. The effect of his prints in this method after Reynolds and Millais was mechanical and out of harmony with the picturesque technique of these painters, but the phenomenal popularity which Cousins gained for his works at least kept alive and in favor a form of mezzotint engraving during a critical phase of its history. Abraham Raimbach, the line engraver, dated the decline of his own art in England from the appearance in 1837 of Cousins's print (in the mixed style) after Landseer's Bolton Abbey. Such plates as Miss Peel, after Lawrence (published in 1833); A Midsummer Nights Dream, after Landseer (1857); The Order of Release and The First inuet, after Millais (1856 and 1868); The Strawberry Girl and Lavinia, Countess Spencer, after Reynolds; and Miss Rich, after Hogarth (1873-1877), represent various stages of Cousins's mixed method. It reached its final development in the plates after Millais's Cherry Ripe and Pomona, published it in 1881 and 1882, when the invention of coating copper-plates with a film of steel to make them yield larger editions led to the revival of pure mezzotint on copper, which has since rendered obsolete the steel plate and the mixed style which it fostered. The fine draughtsmanship of Cousins was as apparent in his prints as in his original lead-pencil portraits exhibited in London in 1882. In 1885 he was elected a full member of the Royal Academy, to which institution he later gave in trust 15,000 to provide annuities for superannuated artists who had not been so successful as himself. One of the most important figures in the history of British engraving, he died in London, unmarried, on May 7 1887."

It is assumed he did this to move farther away from those who wished him dead. George Mitchell, the brother of Esther Mitchell (the 17-year-old girl whom Edmund Creffield had said would be the ``Bride of Christ'' incarnate), followed Creffield and his followers to Seattle, and shot Creffield behind the left ear on a street corner, killing him. Mitchell was tried for the murder of Edmund Creffield, but was later acquitted of the crime. Shortly after he was acquitted, Mitchell was in the process of boarding a train when suddenly his sister Esther shot him in exactly the same way, killing him. Esther was then sent to an insane asylum and later committed suicide."

        "snippet": "Don E. Crabtree was born in Heyburn, Idaho on June 8, 1912. He finished high school in Twin Falls in 1930, after which he worked for the Idaho Power Company. After a brief period he traveled to California where he enrolled in Long Beach Junior College in the mid 1930'ss with the intent to major in geology and paleontology. Crabtree was noted as being a thinker-while-doing, highly active, and not enjoying studying; due to this he dropped out of Long Beach Junior College after only one term to go his own route. In 1939 he discovered he had cancer, and this discovery briefly impeded his self-study in archeology. During the war years he met his wife, Evelyn, and married in 1943 while working for the Bethlehem Steel Company in California. Crabtree would spend the next 30 years educating and assisting some of the biggest names in archeology at the time such as Alfred Kroeber. Crabtree was also asked for his advice at influential sites like the Clovis type site. After a highly successful career he died in Twin Falls, Idaho on November 16, 1980 of complications due to heart disease."

Raised in China as the son of missionaries, he returned to the United States and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy (1925). He taught at University of Minnesota and Marshall College before undertaking the Han shu translation project at the behest of the American Council of Learned Societies. Subsequently, Dubs taught at Duke University, Columbia University and Hartford Seminary, before taking up the Chair of Chinese at Oxford that had been held by James Legge. He retired in 1959 and remained on in Oxford until his death."

During the invasion of the Russian Red Army towards Konigsberg she fled to Wilhelmshafen in the North of Germany with her mother. As a child of a midwife and a policeman she had no possibility to visit a university to study arts and therefore decided to learn the artisanry of a photographer. After a three-year traineeship at Oldenburg/Germany she traveled to numerous places in Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland to work as a portrait photographer. Some years later she worked as a landscape photographer and published several books. http://www.antikbuch24.de/suchergebnisse.php?searchPhrase=chris%20nowotny&seller_id=&section=&sortType=3http://www.amazon.de/dp/3444060173 In 1953/1955 she was at the Vienna Higher Graphical Academy to successfully master her examination for the grade of master in photography. In 1967 she gave birth to her son Niki :de: Niki Nowotny, who became an audio-book narrator and journalist. From the end of the 1960s on Chris Nowotny worked as a still photographer for the Munich theaters and as a portrait photographer for many famous international TV stars and actors (e.g. Curd Jurgens, Heinz Ruhmann, Telly Savalas, Mel Ferrer). Since 1977 she spezialized herself in portraits of children and babies for advertising and international photo agencys (e.g. Tony Stone Worldwide). Nowotny died on March 18, 1989, in Berg, Upper Bavaria at Lake Starnberg, near Munich from bowel cancer; she was 60 years old. In memory of her 80th birthday and the 850th anniversary of the city of Munich a Munich-based publishing company http://www.brainscript.de published a book http://munich50years.de/Munich_50_Years/The_book.htmlhttp://www.nabehr.de/2010/11/17/bildband-munchen-50-jahre-in-bildern of her best shots from Munich.

There were border disputes and a threat of invasion by the United States into Canada near Montreal. Early in 1847 he set up his headquarters in Montreal. He remained in Montreal until his death in 1849. He was originally buried at the Papineau military cemetery in Montreal. However, the graves had to be moved because they were in the way of building a new access ramp to the Jacques-Cartier bridge. Sir Benjamin d'Urban's remains now rest at the Last Post Fund National Field of Honour, a military cemetery owned by the Last Post Fund in Pointe-Claire where there is an obelisk to his memory. On the obelisk, there are four plaques: a memorial plaque from the officers of the British Army serving in Canada, a second memorial plaque donated by the City of Durban, one explaining the exhumation and reburial by the Last Post Fund, and one explaining the reburial of the other remains in D'Urban Circle."

The pair extended their business to Siam, Borneo and Burma before selling the company in 1927. Newman returned to Caboolture, and on 16 February 1927 married Gwendoline Nita Stephenson; they settled in a thirty-eight room mansion. Newman bought extensive property in rural Queensland and the Northern Territory, acquiring dairy farms, pineapple plantations, and cattle studs. In 1942 he was appointed controller of minerals production and given the task of increasing production of strategic minerals like tungsten and tin. He moved briefly to Melbourne, during which time the Royal Australian Navy used his home; he later donated the property as a war veterans' home and lived in Beachmere. Appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957, he was awarded the medal of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in 1960. He died at St Lucia in 1973."

These four men were the Earl Marshal (the Earl of Norfolk), Hugh Bigod, John Maunsell, and the Earl of Warwick (John du Plessis). Not only did he arrange the marriage of Henry III daughter, Margaret of England to Alexander III of Scotland in 1249, but he entertained the courts of England and Scotland on King Alexander's visit to London in 1256. Such a feat would not have been possible but for the income from his pluralities. He was named Seneschal of Gascony in 1243 a post later held by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and subsequently by Prince Edward. Alfonso of Castile had his eyes on Gascony and John Maunsell helped to defuse the situation by arranging the marriage of Edward to Alfonso's half-sister, Eleanor in 1254. Sedgwick castle came into his hands in 1249. In 1261 he was named Constable of the Tower of London. He was mediator along with Simon de Montfort in arranging the marriage of Henry's daughter Beatrice with John of Brittany in 1259. John Maunsell was in France with Queen Eleanor and Edmund when Simon de Montfort vanquished Henry III at the Battle of Lewes, 14 May 1264. Shortly thereafter, Simon de Montfort took possession of Maunsell's estates in August of 1264. John Maunsell died 20 January 1265 in Florence and was buried in York Minster. Among his contemporaries were the better known Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and Roger Bacon."

In 1855 he was appointed professor of mineralogy and geology at the Polytechnic Institute at Karlsruhe, and he took part in the geological survey of Baden. From 1863 to 1896 he was professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Wurzburg. His great work Die Land- und Susswasser-Conchylien der Vorwelt was published in 1870-1875. Later he issued an authoritative work on mineral veins, Untersuchungen ber Erz gauge (1882--1885). He died at Wurzburg on the 11th of April 1898. His brother Guido Sandberger (1821--1869) was an authority on fossil cephalopoda, and together they published Die Versteinerungen des rheinischen Schichiensystems in Nassau (1850--1856)."

        "snippet": "In 1786 he published a catechism, valuable as indicating the departure from the old standards of doctrine, already hinted at in the terms of his subscription. The questions are precisely those of the Westminster Shorter Catechism; the answers are naked extracts from Scripture, without comment. In the second edition, 1825, a further progress is made; some of the Westminster questions are omitted, others are altered. Bankhead was moderator of synod in 1800. On 30 July 1812 William Glendy (died 24 July 1853, aged 71) was ordained as his assistant and successor. In 1829 Glendy took the congregation with him to join the heterodox remonstrant synod; but Bankhead remained on the roll of the general synod till his death, which occurred on 5 July 1833, he being then in the ninety-sixth year of his age, and the seventieth of his ministry (the inscription on his tombstone overestimates on both points). It is remarkable that the whole period of 220 years (1613--1833) in the history of Ballycarry congregation is spanned by the pastorates of four men, the interstices between their ministries amounting collectively to seventeen years. Bankhead was a man of much natural ability. A satirical poem of 1817 (''The Ulster Synod,`` by Rev. William Heron, of Ballyclare) describes him, in his eightieth year, as ''scattering bright wit, sound sense, and Dublin snuff. `` He published: 1. ''Faith the Spring of Holiness`` ii. 4, Belf. 1769 (funeral sermon for Arch. Edmonstone of Redhall, who left Bankhead his library). 2. ''A Catechism,`` &c. Belf. 1786, 12mo (the date is misprinted 1736); 2nd ed. Belf. 1825, 12mo (described above). He was twice married, (1) to Jane Martin, (2) in February 1812 to Mary Magill, and was the father of twenty-two children, nineteen of whom reached maturity, and some found distinction. His eldest son was John Bankhead, M.D., a leading physician of Belfast. Another was James Bankhead, ordained 23 March 1796, presbyterian minister of Bromore, co. Down (d. 10 Jan. 1824). Another son, Charles Bankhead, M.D., was private physician to the celebrated Lord Londonderry, who expired in his arms in 1822; he died at Florence, aged 91, and was father of Charles Bankhead, British envoy to Washington. The latest survivor of the twenty-two children was William Bankhead, unitarian minister at Brighton and Diss, Norfolk (1837--43), who left the ministry, and died in Edinburgh, 1881, aged 69."

        "snippet": "In Queen Anne's reign, in his old age, the Duke of Leeds was described as ``a gentleman of admirable natural parts, great knowledge and experience in the affairs of his own country, but of no reputation with any party. He hath not been regarded, although he took his place at the council board''. The veteran statesman, however, by no means acquiesced in his enforced retirement, and continued to take an active part in politics. As a zealous churchman and Protestant he still possessed a following. In 1705 he supported a motion that the church was in danger, and in 1710 in Henry Sacheverell's case spoke in defence of hereditary right. In November of this year he obtained a renewal of his pension of 3500 a year from the post office which he was holding in 1694, and in 1711 at the age of eighty was a competitor for the office of Lord Privy Seal. Leeds's long and eventful career, however, terminated soon afterwards by his death in Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, England on 26 July 1712."

In the late 1940s, she undertook a pioneering project at a Long Island hospital to explore the therapeutic role music could play in treating the mentally ill. She continued to work actively as a music therapist for many years, and eventually became a highly respected educator within the field. An annual scholarship in her name is offered by the American Music Therapy Association. She died in Southbury, Connecticut at the age of 88."

After serving as alcalde and in other public offices, Castro was granted Rancho San Pablo in 1823 by Governor Luis Antonio Arguello. The land had previously been grazing land for cattle belonging to the Mission San Francisco de Asis, but was secularized by the new Mexican republic. He and his family moved to the rancho some time after 1824. He died in 1831 at San Pablo. His sons Victor Castro and Juan Jose Castro were the grantees of Rancho El Sobrante in 1841."

Buhrer was born near Zoar, Ohio, in Tuscarawas County to Johann Casper and Anna Maria Miller Buhrer. His father died in 1829 and Buhrer was entrusted to the Society of Separatists until he was old enough. Buhrer was educated mainly in Sunday School until he was twelve and he started learning a trade. Buhrer left the farm and traveled to Cleveland to work as a cooper. Buhrer then became a traveling salesman before returning to Cleveland to open his own coopering shop. He sold his shop and then began distilling alcohol for a living until he eventually became a wholesale distributor of alcoholic beverages. Buhrer was a three-term member of the city council until he was elected as mayor of Cleveland in 1867. The Cleveland House of Correction & Workhouse was built under his term as mayor. After serving two terms, he returned to serve another term on the city council before he died in Cleveland in 1907."

McKay also floated the idea of sponsorship of the One O'clock Gun, in order to secure its future. He undertook fundraising work for the Army Benevolent Fund, and in 2002 published a book of anecdotes and history relating to the gun, entitled, What Time Does Edinburgh's One O'clock Gun Fire? , the proceeds of which went towards the fund. McKay also appeared on BBC Scotland's Hogmanay Live programme, firing the gun to mark the New Year. He continued to fire the gun until his retirement on 27 January 2005. He died at his home in Dunfermline at the age of 60."

A eulogy was delivered by former President Jimmy Carter, who said We have known kings and queens, and we've known presidents and prime ministers, but the most extraordinary person whom I have ever known in my life is Mattie Stepanek. His life philosophy was 'Remember to play after every storm! ' and his motto was: 'Think Gently, Speak Gently, Live Gently'. He wanted to be remembered as ``a poet, a peacemaker, and a philosopher who played''."

In 1883, the British tried to restore Cetshwayo to rule at least part of his previous territory but the attempt failed. With the aid of Boer mercenaries, Chief UZibhebhu started a war contesting the succession and on 22 July 1883 he attacked Cetshwayo's new kraal in Ulundi. Cetshwayo was wounded but escaped to Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal forest. After pleas from the Resident Commissioner, Sir Melmoth Osborne, the king moved to Eshowe, where he died a few months later, presumably from a heart attack, though possibly he was poisoned. His body was buried within sight of the forest, to the south near Nkunzane River. The remains of the wagon which carried his corpse to the site was placed on the grave, and its remains may be seen at Ondini Museum, near Ulundi."

        "snippet": "Bray was the only son of Edward Bray, solicitor, and manager of the Devonshire estates of the Duke of Bedford, was born at the Abbey House, Tavistock, 18 Dec. 1778. His mother, Mary, a daughter of Dr. Brandreth of Houghton Regis, and the widow of Arthur Turner, would not allow her son to be sent to a public school, and he was educated by himself, a circumstance which engendered in him habits of isolation and restraint. At an early age he cultivated poetry, two small selections from his effusions circulating among his friends before he was twenty-three. Bray became a student at the Middle Temple in 1801 and was called to the bar in 1806. For some time he went the western circuit, but the profession of the law had from the first ill accorded with his disposition, and after five years of trial he abandoned it for the Church. He was ordained by the Bishop of Norwich about 1811, and in the following year, by the favour of the Duke of Bedford, became the vicar of Tavistock and the perpetual curate of Brent Tor. Almost immediately after his ordination he entered himself at Trinity College, Cambridge, and took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity as a ten-year man in 1822. In Tavistock he resided for the rest of his life, and if he differed from his parishioners on politics or preached over their heads, he retained their respect. He married the widow of C. A. Stothard Bray, Anna Eliza, and an amusing account of the habits of the worthy vicar and his wife is embodied in the latter's autobiography. Bray died at Tavistock 17 July 1857. During his lifetime he published several selections of sermons: 'Sermons from the Works of the most eminent Divines of the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries,' 1818. 'Discourses from Tracts and Treatises of eminent Divines,' 1821. 'Select Sermons by Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man,' and a volume of his own, 'Discourses on Protestantism,' 1829. His poetical productions were for the most part circulated privately. After Bray's death his widow collected and published his 'Poetical Remains' (1859, 2 vols.), and also 'A Selection from the Sermons, General and Occasional, of Rev. E. A. Bray' (1860, 2 vols.) At one time he projected a history of his native town of Tavistock, and made considerable collections for it, but the undertaking was never completed. Many extracts from his journals describing the curiosities of Dartmoor and many of his poems are inserted in Mrs. Bray's 'Tamar and Tavy. ' When she published her work on Switzerland she embodied with it many passages in the diary which her husband kept whilst on the tour."

His senior thesis there, a string quartet, was recorded by the Juilliard Quartet. He then went to the University of California, Berkeley, where he received an M.A. in Music in 1947; there he continued to study with Sessions, who had taken a position at Berkeley. Imbrie taught composition, theory, and analysis at Berkeley from 1949 until his retirement in 1991. In addition to his principal teaching job at Berkeley, he served as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, Brandeis University, Northwestern University, New York University, the University of Alabama, and Harvard University, and had a regular teaching post at the San Francisco Conservatory. He died at his home in Berkeley, California at the age of 86. His notable students included Larry Austin, Neil Rolnick and Leslie Wildman."

He was Greek reader in his college, and was appointed Hebrew professor of the university about 1538, in succession to Robert Wakefeld. In April 1542 he obtained permission from the university to expound in the public schools the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew language, 'provided that he lectured in a pious and catholic manner. ' He died at Agmondesham, Buckinghamshire, in July 1542. When his death became known at Oxford many learned men composed Greek and Latin verses to his memory, and pasted them on the doors of St. Mary's Church. These verses, together with some of Shepreve's own compositions, were collected with a view to their publication, under the editorship of George Etheridge, but they never appeared in print. Several authors, including John Leland and Dr. John White, celebrated his memory in their books of poems."

He read law books extensively during his hours outside of school and in the early 1850s was appointed Deputy Clerk of the Supreme Court of Appeals at Lewisburg (now in West Virginia). He still pursued the study of law when he was not working. Being admitted to the bar shortly afterwards, he moved to Mercer County and began practice. This was interrupted by military service in the Civil War. After the war, he settled at Marion in Smyth County, where he had a large practice. He became a member of the Readjuster Party and, in February, 1882, was elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals. After serving his twelve-year term, he retired in January 1895 and returned to Marion where he died in November 1895."

It is most probable that he studied philosophy and theology at the University of Bologna. He taught with great success in various schools of his order in Italy. In 1592 he was sent by Pope Clement VIII and the General of the Dominicans, Beccaria, to accompany the Apostolic Nuncio to Prague to combat the prevailing heresies. There he spent three years teaching in the Studium Generale of the province, lecturing on theology in the university, preaching and defending Catholicism against the innovators. Returning to Italy in 1596 he became regent of studies in the convent at Milan. In 1597 the pope appointed him to defend in a public disputation at Chiavenna the Catholic doctrine of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass against Calvinistic preachers. His learning and eloquence won for him such a triumph that his services were sought in other parts of the country. In 1620 the citizens of Milan chose him as ambassador to the Royal Court of Philip III of Spain to adjust certain matters of Importance to Milan; in May, 1622 he represented as definitor the ecclesiastical province of Lombardy at the Dominican general chapter held at Milan. He spent the close of his life at Bologna where he occupied himself with teaching and writing, until he died in Bologna, Italy, in 1645."

In 1955 he was named Head of the Switching Research Department and began work on the Experimental Solid State Exchange (ESSEX), a pioneering solid-state system using pulse-code modulation and a central time-division switch. In 1958 Vaughan became Director of the Systems Research Center, and in 1962 moved to the Switching Systems Development Area. In 1968, Vaughan assumed overall responsibility for planning and developing No. 4 ESS. He died on March 9, 1978 in Pinehurst, North Caolina."

He and his nephew, Imre Angster established a second factory at Rakospalota and introduced some technical innovations. The communist takeover resulted in the factory being closed as far as organ manufacturing was concerned. However, since 1992 a new workshop was set up in Pecs with backing by Jozsef Angster."

In 1896, the Central Welsh Board for Intermediate Education was established, with Arthur Humphreys-Owen (Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire) as its first chairman and John Viriamu Jones (the first vice-chancellor of the University of Wales) as vice-chairman. The Board had the responsibility of overseeing the Welsh Intermediate Schools, and this was done through an annual examination and inspection. Owen was appointed as the Board's first chief inspector in 1896. He held the position until 1915, when illness compelled his retirement, and was regarded as having held the office ``with exceptional ability and conscientiousness''. He was succeeded in the post by William Edwards, a former fellow of Jesus College. After his enforced retirement, he moved to Colwyn Bay on the coast of North Wales, where he died on 14 March 1920; he was buried in the cemetery at Llandrillo-yn-Rhos."

        "snippet": "On Calvert's return to Britain he was appointed Deputy Quartermaster General at the Horseguards, then Deputy Adjudant General 1796. He was made Colonel of the 5th West India Regt and Adjudant General 26th Jan 1797. At this time ``Calvert was a rising star, already Deputy Adjudant General, and engaged to a niece of Mr. Greenwood, a partner in Cox, Greenwood, Cox & Co., the army agents. Malicious gossip had it that this connexion was likely to do more for him than any show of martial brilliance, for the Duke of York was known to have heavy financial obligations to the firm. But Calvert had more than good looks and influence; he stood firmly for the (staff) college''. In 1799, having already served as deputy Adjutant-General, he was made Adjutant-General to the Forces, holding this role until 1818. In this capacity he effected many improvements in the organization and discipline of the service. He greatly improved the administration of the army medical and hospital department, introduced regimental schools, developed the two existing military colleges (since united at Sandhurst), and was largely responsible for the founding of the Duke of York's School, Chelsea. Promoted Major General on 29th Sept 1803, and Lieutenant General 25th Oct 1809, in recognition of his work as adjutant general he was made a GCB in 1815, and, on retiring from office, received a baronetcy in 1818. In 1820 he was made Lieutenant-Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, and elevated to Full General 1821. He died on the 3rd of September 1826, at Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire."

A mid-eleventh-century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child, and was then murdered by his tutor scberht at the behest of Cwoenthryth. This version of events ``bristles with historical problems'', according to one historian, and it is also possible that Cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in Coenwulf's reign, and who appears to have died by about 812. The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point: Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince, and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father's reign. Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm's legend, there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf's reign: a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf ``much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings, nobles, bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business''."

In April 1945, he briefly entered the liberated Dachau concentration camp in Germany and saw many dead bodies and near-dead survivors. After Germany's surrender, he was working in an Army motor pool in Austria when General William J. (``Wild Bill'') Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), recruited Sonnenfeldt to be his personal interpreter because he spoke both German and English fluently. Donovan soon became the first deputy of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who had been appointed by President Truman to serve as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. Sonnenfeldt moved with Donovan into that project, first to Paris and then to Nuremberg."

In December 1875 he was a part of the majority of the committee which appointed Johan Peter Weisse as professor, in preference to Jan Johanssen. Schreiner married his cousin Gunhild Heiberg Wiborg (1848--1932) in November 1872, and he was the brother-in-law of Sophus Bugge. Another of his cousins was the father of Kristian Schreiner.

        "snippet": "His debut came in Handel's 1734 revival of Il pastor fido, which was a great success. He continued to sing for Handel, creating roles in ten of his operas and performing in every one of Handel's English-language oratorios, odes, and music dramas, with the sole exception of The Choice of Hercules. He also performed for Thomas Arne, and sang at the Chapel Royal. His marriage, during 1739, to Lady Henrietta Herbert, only daughter of James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave caused much scandal: Lord Egmont commented that ``there is no prudence below the girdle''. Lady Herbert died in 1753 and in 1759 he married again, this time to Charlotte Rich, whose father was the proprietor of the opera house in Covent Garden. After he died in 1761 Beard succeeded to the role until 1767, when deafness forced him to retire, selling Covent Garden's ownership for 60,000. He died at Hampton. Handel created several heroic leading roles for Beard, a revolution in the heyday of the castrato voice. The title roles in Samson, Judas Maccabeus, and Jeptha call for strength and expressive qualities over agility. He also sang the role of Farmer Hawthorne in the world premiere of Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. Charles Burney commented that he ``constantly possessed the favour of the public by his superior conduct, knowledge of Music, and intelligence as an actor.'' Burney's article in Rees's Cyclopaedia noted that Beard, ``an energetic English singer, and an excellent actor, was brought up in the king's chapel. He knew as much of music as was necessary to sing a single part at sight, and with a voice that was more powerful than sweet, he became the most useful and favourite singer of his time, on the stage, at Ranelagh, at all concerts; and in Handel's oratorios he had always a capital part, being by his knowledge of music the most steady support of the choruses, not only of Handel, but in the odes of Green and Boyce''."

Hindersin had pleaded, in season and out of season, for the establishment of a school of gunnery; and in spite of want of funds, such a school had already been established. After 1866, however, more support was obtained, and the improvement in the Prussian field artillery between 1866 and 1870 was extraordinary, even though there had not been time for the work of the school, to leaven the whole arm. Indeed, the German artillery played by far the most important part in the victories of the Franco-Prussian War. Hindersin accompanied the king's headquarters as chief of artillery, as he had done in 1866, and was present at Gravelotte, Sedan and the siege of Paris. But his work, which was now accomplished, had worn out his physical powers, and he died in 1872 at Berlin."

Pontano had already lost his only son by the first marriage; therefore his declining years were solitary. He died in 1503 at Naples, where a remarkable group of terracotta figures, life-sized and painted, still adorns his tomb in the church of Monte Oliveto. He is there represented together with his patron Alfonso and his friend Jacopo Sannazaro in adoration before the dead Christ."

At the age of five his education began at Liege, where he spent eleven years mastering the difficulties of the trivium and quadrivium. At the age of sixteen he received the habit of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine in the Abbey of Cantimpre, where he was eventually elevated to the priesthood. In 1232 after fifteen years at Cantimpre, during which he was a constant source of edification to his religious brethren, he entered the Order of St. Dominic at Leuven, also in Brabant. Immediately after his profession in the following year, he was sent to Cologne to pursue the higher theological studies of the order, under the tutelage of the illustrious Albert the Great. From Cologne, where he spent four years, he went to Paris, to the Dominican studium of St. James, to perfect himself in the sciences and to prepare for the apostolate of preaching. Returning to Louvain in 1240, he was made professor of philosophy and theology--an office he filled with rare distinction. He achieved equal success in the apostolate of preaching, in recognition of which the title of ``Preacher General'' was conferred upon him. His missionary activities extended throughout Brabant and into Germany, Belgium, and France."

He was named deputy provincial secretary in 1812 and, in 1818, registrar for the Court of Chancery. With Martin Gay Black and others, he helped establish the Halifax Banking Company in 1825, serving as first president for the bank. In 1831, Cogswell was named to the province's Council. He also served as commissioner of the vice admiralty court and president of the Halifax Board of Health. Cogswell was president of the Albion Fire and Life Insurance Company and of the Annapolis Iron Mining Company. An obvious target for political reformers, he lost most of his political appointments by 1841. Cogswell helped support the Halifax Mechanics' Institute, was a generous supporter of King's College and contributed to Halifax charities. In his later years, he lobbied for a railway link between Halifax and Quebec City. He died at Halifax at the age of 78."

Time and Eternity (1935) marks the conversion to Catholicism Murilo Mendes. In this book, the humorous elements decrease and visual values of the text are highlighted. It was written in collaboration with poet Jorge de Lima.In the volumes of the next phase, Poetry in Scream (1938), The Visionary (1941), The Metamorphoses (1944) and World Puzzle (1945), the poet presents cubist influence, overlapping images and making the plastic on the predominant discourse. Poetry Freedom (1947), as some other books of the poet, was written under the impact of war, reflecting the author's concern about the situation in the world. In 1954, he left Contemplation of Ouro Preto, where Murilo Mendes changed their language and their concerns, referring to the old mining towns and its atmosphere. Thereafter, the poet threw himself into new stylistic processes, making a poetry of a more rigorous and stripped, as in the Parable (1946-1952) and Sicily (1954-1955), published in Poems (1925-1955). The characteristics of this period reached their best achievement in Spanish Book Time (1959). In 1970, Murilo Mendes Convergence published a book of avant-garde poetry.

Whilst prisoner of war, Mr. Ashworth made several remarkable attempts to recover his freedom; and at last, having escaped from Bitche in December 1808, he succeeded in passing through Germany to Trieste, where he got on board the English frigate L'Unite. In the October following he was promoted to be a lieutenant, and was serving in that rank in the Centaur of 74 guns, on the coast of Spain, when the French took Tarragona, on 28 June 1811, and drove a number of the panic-stricken inhabitants, literally, into the sea. Lieutenant Ashworth had command of one of the boats sent to rescue these drowning wretches, and, whilst so employed, received a wound, of which he died a month later, at Minorca, 25 July 1811."

Because his group did not meet another group of explorers to continue with, Mirko decided to proceed deeper into the rainforest around Huayabamba river, on his own, not to be seen again. In the aftermath, numerous theories about his disappearance arose, including murder, loss, even cannibalism, but none was ever proven. After his older brother's disappearance, Stjepan kept moving, searching for mineral deposits in south and Central America until, in 1917, he decided to settle and made his home in Ouro Preto, Brazil, where he died in 1936."

He died at Trnava on December 20, 1891 (19 Kislev 5652 on the Hebrew calendar). At age thirteen in 1829 he entered the Yeshiva of the Chassam Sofer and studied there for nine years until 1838. He became close to his teacher who he writes was like a father to him, he served him and ate at his table (something very few students of the Chasam Sofer merited). In that year in 1838 he returned home and married his wife Rachel who was also from his hometown Nadash. There in Nadash he taught young students for seven years until he was appointed rabbi of Cifer in 1845. He was rabbi of Cifer for ten years where he taught bright students until in 1856 he was appointed as rabbi of the newly founded Jewish community of Trnava which had been closed to Jews since they were expelled from it in c. 1555. He died in Trnava in 1891 leaving his wife and three sons; Asher who was at that time rabbi of Vershetz, Shmuel, and Itzik. Two of his children died young; his eldest son Dovid at age 24, and daughter Sarel at age 27."

Raimondo also worked at and on items found at Pompeii, and one of his most important works deals with life in that ancient city. In addition, he was often consulted for his expert opinion in classical matters and worked on the Royal Collections at Naples, such as The Bourbon Museum. Guarini corresponded and collaborated with other classical scholars and archaeologists of the time, including German archaeologists August Emil Braun and Eduard Gerhard, and German classical scholar and Nobel Laureate Theodor Mommsen. The debates with Mommsen were legendary in their time. Guarini was also a pioneer in the study of the Oscan language. He was a first to create an Oscan/Latin Dictionary. His other works, numbering close to one hundred, range from brief monographs to books. Many of his works can be found today in the libraries of larger colleges and universities (Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Duke, Columbia etc.). By far, the largest collection of his works may be found at the Vatican Library in Rome. Guarini played an important role in the popular Classical Movement of the 1800s, centered at Naples in Southern Italy, after the rediscovery of Pompeii. He died on January 8, 1852 at Naples. A secondary school, Scuola Secondaria Di 1 Grado Statale ``R. Guarini'' in his hometown of Mirabella Eclano, was named in his honor."

He saw Islam being crushed gradually from Bengal and his people downtrodden by Hindu and British zamindars. Muslims had become superstitious and gone astray. Islam was being invaded by non-islamic religions, traditions, customs and cultures. Government imposed unnecessary taxes upon the farmers and the low class. Farmers were not appreciated for their hard work nor were given rights or money they deserved. Britishers had crushed the Muslims economically at their arrival in subcontinent so that they could not rise against them. They also made sure that Muslims should remain illiterate and uneducated. Thus, Muslims became politically backward and were unaware of laws and regulations. Due to this, Haji Shariatullah started this movement in 1818. He was sure that a revival of Islam is crucially necessary. Haji Shariatullah awakened the Muslims of Bengal by initiating the Faraizi movement. It was simply a peaceful protest against the cruelty of the government. This alarmed the Hindu and British Landlords and they exiled Haji Shariatullah to Nawabganj, accused of being behin the protest and disturbance in East Bengal. Later he died in Dhaka district in 1840. But the movement was carried along by his son, Mohsin-ul-Mulk, who was more learned and active in the movement than his father. He divided the East Bengal into areas he called circles and appointed khalifas for each of them. The khalifas were made responsible for the social, political and religious development of the circles."

        "snippet": "Neale's earliest works were drawings of insects. While in search of specimens in Hornsey Wood in the spring of 1796, Neale met John Varley the water-colour painter. Together they projected a work to be entitled The Picturesque Cabinet of Nature, for which Varley was to make the landscape drawings, and Neale was to etch and colour the plates. No. 1 was published on 1 September 1796, but no more appeared. He was a clerk in the General Post Office, but eventually resigned his appointment to devote his time to art. Neale died at Tattingstone, near Ipswich, aged 67, on 14 November 1847."

He painted throughout the country, in Massachusetts, New Mexico, California, and New York. He returned to Maine in 1937, after declaring that he wanted to become ``the painter of Maine'' and depict American life at a local level. This aligned Hartley with the Regionalism movement, a group of artists active from the early to mid 20th century that attempted to represent a distinctly ``American art.'' He continued to paint in Maine, primarily scenes around Lovell and the Corea coast, until his death in Ellsworth in 1943. His ashes were scattered on the Androscoggin River."

Marbach also took an active part in bringing about the acceptance of the Formula of Concord; and prevailed on the Strasbourg theologians to sign the Zerbst Formula (1571), while the official acceptance of the Formula of Concord was opposed by the town council. In the Palatinate he assisted Louis VI in 1576 to restore Lutheranism after the death of Frederick III. He died at Strasbourg."

In the Quirinal, he painted 'The Judgment of Solomon,' and others of his works are in Santa Maria Maggiore and in the Rotunda. Carlo Cesio was also an engraver of some eminence; we have by him several plates after the Italian painters of his time. His plates are etched and finished off with the graver, in a free, masterly style. His drawing is generally correct, and his prints have the effect of the works of a painter. The following are his principal works as an engraver:"

Bishop Brossart was responsible for placing the finishing touches on the current cathedral, though it is still unfinished to this day. During the First World War he had to suffer public attacks because he was a born German. He declared himself as a supporter of the American positions and developed a pronounced patriotic activity. In that frame he pushed also back the different emigration languages in his diocese (including his own motherlanguage) and allowed only Latin and English as the official prayer-languages. The prelate translated different German theological books into English, among them works of the famous monk Henry Denifle. Bishop Brossart served a long term, resigning on March 14, 1923, due to ill health. Brossart retired to St. Anne Convent in Melbourne, Kentucky, where he died on August 6, 1930. The bishop is the namesake of Bishop Brossart High School in Alexandria."

During this period she was invited back to the Yaddo artist's colony and also accepted a residency at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire. In 1960, Slobodkina married William Urquhart, a business owner whom she had met in 1942 at an American Abstract Artists show. They were married for three years, but in 1963, Urquhart died after suffering from a prolonged illness. Slobodkina stated that ``it took me some six years to just recover from the grief and life in general was never the same''... In 1967, Slobodkina and her mother began travelling to Florida to be close to her sister. Annual trips to the southern state soon became impractical because of her mother's failing health and in 1979, they permanently relocated to Hallandale, Florida. After the death of Slobodkina's brother-in-law in 1974 and her mother in 1975, her sister Tamara joined her in her Hallandale home. The two sisters continued to live together for the rest of Slobodkina's life, moving from Hallandale to West Hartford, CT, then back to Great Neck before settling in Glen Head, Long Island."

He is best known for his research in the anatomy of the coronary arteries and the electrical conduction system of the heart. He served as president of the American Heart Association, the International Society and Federation of Cardiology, and the Tenth World Congress of Cardiology. He retired in 2004, and returned to Birmingham, Alabama, where he died in 2010. His greatest influence, however, was upon his grandchildren, within whom he helped instill a drive toward achievement and excellence. His grandson, Thomas Fenner James, continues in his medical footsteps at Dr. James' alma mater, Tulane University."

Y., on August 5, 1836; he died in Evansville, Indiana on April 10, 1887. His first appearance was made on June 27, 1853, at a theatre in Rochester, New York, under the management of Messrs., Carr and Henry Warren, as Lopez, in ``The Honeymoon.'' Afterward, he went to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile. and New Orleans. In 1858 he made his early success with Sothern in Tom Taylor's Our American Cousin, in which he afterward appeared in London and in Paris. Raymond first became known in New York in 1861, when he appeared at Laura Keene's Theatre, succeeding Joseph Jefferson in low comedy parts, and at that time he acted Asa Trenchard in ``Our American Cousin.'' His greatest popular hit, however, was as Col. Mulberry Sellers in a dramatization of Mark Twain's (1873), a character that became completely identified with his own breezy optimism. Raymond's professional career extended over a period of thirty-two years, in the course of which he acted in all the parts that usually fall to the lot of a low comedian."

Previously to this he had made a trigonometrical survey of part of the Algarves in Portugal in 1836. He was appointed professor of civil engineering and architecture at Putney College in 1849, and in the same year lecturer on civil engineering to the royal engineers at Chatham, which latter post he held to his death. In 1855 he was sent by the government to Demerara to report upon the sea walls there, and to superintend the works for their restoration. He died at Putney, Surrey, 25 July 1856, aged only forty-two. At the time of his decease he was engaged in maturing a plan for removing all the gas manufactories in London to a considerable distance from the metropolis, and concentrating them at a spot on the Essex shore. He was author of a treatise on coal-gas, 1850. He died at Putney on 25 July 1856, leaving a widow and a young family."

        "snippet": "Bocock and R. L. McWhorter taught, in 1910, a major graduate course in Greek which consisted of literary selections and exercises in grammar, written and spoken Greek, history, and poetry. The course description points out a problem with early graduate education at the University of Georgia that was common with many other institutions: ``studied from sources so far as the library resources of the University permit.'' Bocock also taught, by himself, ``An Introduction to New Testament Greek.'' These classes were in addition to undergraduate teaching and his duties as Dean. The New Testament Greek class was not offered after 1913 and after 1923, Bocock taught the major Greek class by himself. Bocock often decried the declining interest by students in Greek, symptomatic of this is the fact that the 1931-32 Graduate Bulletin notes: ``For courses in Greek Literature, consult the professor.'' 207 After 1931, the Greek Literature class would be transformed into ``Introduction of European Literature'' which had a prerequisite of three years of college-level Latin. Greek literature was no longer studied in the original language but was now ``Greek Literature in Translations.'' In a memorial to Bocock in 1948, Robert Preston Brooks wrote: ``Mr. Bocock was an altogether charming companion. Few men were so perennially delightful. The depth and variety of his knowledge of literature, ancient and modern, and of world history and contemporary affairs was impressive; and he invariably expressed his views in perfect English. No one was ever bored in his presence.'' Bocock continued to serve the Graduate School after leaving the deanship. He served as a member of and advisor to the Graduate Council into the 1940s. He retired from the University of Georgia in 1945. Bocock married Bessie Perry Friend of Petersburg, Virginia in 1885. The Bococks had two children: John Holmes Bocock and Natalie Friend Bocock. Bocock died October 31, 1947 in Richmond, Virginia."

He was not influenced by the empiricism of such contemporaries as John Wisdom, Gilbert Ryle and A.J. Ayer. The 'Metaphysicals', as his small group of fellow thinkers were called, were of an entirely different temper. His thinking was essentially Thomist. One of his closer friends was the Christian apologist C.S. Lewis who dedicated his book on the Psalms to him. Farrer took the last sacraments to Lewis before his death. Others included J.R.R. Tolkien and Dorothy Sayers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Farrer has been more studied and more admired since his death in the United States than in his own country."

        "snippet": "In 1835, James Dakin followed his brother and Gallier to New Orleans. Ambitious, he realized, as Gallier had, the opportunities New Orleans offered. For a time there seems to have been a loose partnership between the three. One example of their collaboration is Barton Academy in Mobile, Alabama, started in 1835. Both James Dakin and Gallier claim to have been the architects of certain New Orleans buildings of the period. Within a year, however, the Dakins left Gallier and practised for a time together as Dakin & Dakin and as Dakin, Bell & Dakin; later still they split. Charles began an ill-fated branch office in Mobile, Alabama, where he supervised the construction of the Government Street Presbyterian Church, completed in 1836. The collapse of a row of warehouses he designed affected him so deeply that it is thought to have been a cause contributing to his early death in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. He had gone to Texas to begin anew. That year (1839) the Great Fire of Mobile also destroyed much of the firm's incomplete work there."

The Dedham Historical Society has a collection of his paintings, sketches and biographical material.

Stigand acted as an advisor to several members of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman English royal dynasties, serving six successive kings. Excommunicated by several popes for his pluralism in holding the two sees, or bishoprics, of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently, he was finally deposed in 1070, and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by William the Conqueror. Stigand was imprisoned at Winchester, where he died without regaining his liberty."

The circumstances about the death of the Cieszyn prince were further narrated by the Italian chronicler Matteo Villenis: according to him, the Polish prince Stefan (obviously the name is erroneous, but from the context, it's clear that only could be Wadysaw) went with part of the Bohemian retinue to Florence, where Wadysaw was covered with high honors from the Emperor. After the banquet given in his honor, the prince fell heavily sick and soon after his return to Pisa he died. The death of his young favorite affected deeply to Charles IV, so that he decided to leave Italy immediately, especially from Pisa. This action caused the eruption of a violent anti-imperial riot, who was bloody clashed."

He studied at the Jesuit College Sainte-Marie de Montreal and at Stonyhurst College in England. He then studied law at the Universite Laval and McGill and was called to the bar in 1867. He began practice in Trois-Rivieres. In 1872, he served as parliamentary correspondent in the provincial assembly for Le Canadien. In 1873, he became a member of the town council in Trois-Rivieres and served as mayor from July 1876 to July 1877. Turcotte was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for Trois-Rivieres in a 1876 by-election as an independent Conservative; he was reelected in 1878. Turcotte served as speaker of the assembly from 1878 to 1882. He was named Queen's Counsel in 1878. In 1879, he helped found La Concorde, becoming its editor. He was defeated in 1881, now running as a Liberal but, after his opponent was unseated because he was accused of bribery, won the seat in an 1884 by-election; he was reelected in 1886. Turcotte condemned the actions of the federal government during the Northwest Rebellion, was part of the campaign in Quebec to save Louis Riel and supported autonomy for the Metis people. In 1884, after La Concorde ceased publication, he helped establish a new newspaper, La Sentinelle. In 1887, he was named minister without portfolio in the cabinet of Honore Mercier and served as attorney general from 1888 to 1890. He was defeated in the 1890 election. Later that year, Turcotte was appointed protonotary for the Superior Court in Montreal district and served until his death in Montreal in 1905. He was buried in Trois-Rivieres."

In this capacity he accompanied Lord Hardinge to the Panjab and drew up an admirable memoir on its resources. As foreign secretary he also visited the western frontier with Lord Dalhousie, on the occasion of the Sikh War, and negotiated the treaty with the Sikh chiefs relative to the settlement of the Panjab and Gujarat, and received the K.C.B. for his services (1849). Throughout his official career he had devoted his leisure to study. At a very early period he conducted a magazine at Mirat which contained many valuable articles on Indian subjects. With a view to assisting the projected official 'Glossary of Indian Judicial and Revenue Terms,' he published in 1845 at Agra his 'Supplement to the Glossary,' which is rightly described by Professor H. H. Wilson as 'replete with curious and valuable information, especially as regards the tribes and clans of Brahmans and Rajputs. ' A second edition appeared in 1860. His chief work, however, was the 'Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Mohammadan India,' in which he proposed to give an analysis of the contents and a criticism of the value of 231 Arabic and Persian historians of India, but of which he only lived to publish the first volume (Calcutta and London, 1849). Failing health compelled him to seek a change of climate, and he died on his way home at Simon's Town, Cape of Good Hope, 20 Dec 1853, aged 45. He married the daughter of W. Cowell, formerly judge at Bareilli."

Returning in Georgia, he was closely allied with Ilia Chavchavadze, a leader of Georgian intellectual life of that time, whom Machabeli offered his assistance in all initiatives aimed at reviving Georgian culture and opposition to the Imperial Russian rule. He served an editor in chief of the leading Georgian national magazines Iveria (1882-3) and Droeba (1883-5). Despite his preoccupation with charities, especially orphanages, and extensive journalism, Machabeli made Shakespeare his life's work. Although, he never visited England, he produced, from 1886 to 1898, the brilliant translations of Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Richard III, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, which to this day serve as the standard versions for the repertoire of the Rustaveli Theatre. Machabeli left his apartment in Tbilisi on June 26, 1898, and was never seen again."

The National Maritime Museum in London has 27 watercolours by him, several of which are mounted on sheets from 18th century printed signal and muster books. He went on to paint numerous naval battle scenes and pictures such as the '''Inshore Squadron off Cadiz in 1797'`` which are thought to show scenes he witnessed. On being appointed Marine Painter to the East India Company he painted ship portraits on commission. It had been thought that he died in 1830, but recent research has found that he painted Queen Victoria's visit to Edinburgh in 1842 before he died in London later that year."

He also published some other works, including The Canadian mercantile almanack, and became sole owner of the newspaper in 1839. He took on other business interests and also served as customs collector at Niagara. Simpson served on the council for Niagara District and the town council for Niagara, serving as mayor from 1852 to 1855. In 1857, he was elected to the Legislative Council for Niagara; he was reelected in 1861 and 1863. In March 1864, he was named to the Executive Council as provincial secretary. Later that year, he resigned his seat, allowing Angus Morrison to enter the cabinet. He was appointed deputy auditor general and served in that post until his death in Ottawa in 1878."

He excelled in painting landscapes and perspective, in which the figures were usually painted by Cherubino. He was also employed by Clement VIII, to paint the sacristy of St. John of Lateran, and, in conjunction with his brothers, to decorate the Sala Clementina in the Vatican. For this work, which was commenced in 1595 and completed in 1598, the two painters (Alessandro had died during the course of execution) received 3050 scudi. Giovanni Alberti also laboured in his native town, in Mantua, Perugia, Florence, and elsewhere. He died at Rome in 1601. His portrait is placed in the academy of St Luke, and another in the Uffizi at Florence."

Slaves awaiting shipment were housed on the islands of Taro and Kamasun. In 1838, Blanco left Africa for Cuba and went to Barcelona, all the time trading in slaves. He left Gallinas just before most of the La Amistad Africans reached his stockades, but he left behind a network of employees to continue his business. It is likely that some of them handled the Amistad Africans. At any rate, he played a vital part in the development of the slave trade in this region. Blanco's business finally collapsed in 1848, and in 1854 he died in Genoa."

Alma took to drinking and smoking, and found that she needed sleeping pills; later, her bow arm started to tremble uncontrollably, leading to more drinking and more sleeping pills. She died on 7 March 1943, aged only 44, during an air raid, although the bombs were not the cause of her death. A doctor reported that she died accidentally of a thrombosis brought on by the mixture of alcohol and pills she had taken, but a number of her close friends believed she suicided. Most sources say this occurred in Frankfurt, although one Australian source says she died in Cologne. Her obituary by the critic Karl Holl concluded: Her violin playing has been silenced. But it leaves behind a ring of rare purity. Her name will always remain as that of a feminine personality in the history of music."

        "snippet": "In 1885, Dawson retired from large-scale training and moved to Exning Manor, which he renamed Melton House. Although he was now in charge of a much smaller number of horses, Dawson continued to have considerable success, winning Classics with the fillies Mimi and Minthe and sending out Minting to win the Grand Prix de Paris. By 1891 Dawson intended to retire completely, but was persuaded to handle a few horses for Lord Rosebery. Now in his seventies, and often unable to walk because of chronic gout, Dawson won a further four Classics for Rosebery, including successive Derby winners in 1894 (Sir Visto) and 1895 (Ladas). Mathew Dawson died at Newmarket on 20 August 1898. It was said of him that in an era in which the sport was often tainted by corruption and dishonesty, he left behind ``a reputation which an archbishop might envy.''"

He was later commissioned as an officer in the 1st Carleton Regiment and was made Deputy Auditor General. Due to his experience of land assessment and transaction in Ontario, he was appointed as Secretary of the Clergy Corporation in 1833 and executed the sale of the controversial Clergy Reserves. By 1838, the Corporation was essentially dissolved and Thomas was appointed Crown Land Agent for the Home District. He continued in this role until 1855 when he tendered his resignation to the Lieutenant Governor following allegations of default. He was shown to be in arrears (the greatest default in pre-Confederation Ontario) and so was forced to cede all his property to the government. From 1844-63 he owned a Brewery at Queen and Niagara Streets called the West Toronto Brewery while he also owned a mill at Innisville. The Brewery was sold to Patrick Cosgrave in 1863 and continued making beer for another eighty years. He was also involved in the incorporation of a number of companies in the Toronto area including the Western Assurance Company in 1851, as well as the Victoria Mining Company and the Toronto and Georgian Bay Canal Company in 1856. Thomas Baines died in 1867 at Toronto."

During the time of his residence at Norwich, he took an active part in most of the religious and philanthropic movements and societies which were carried on in the City. In 1875 he was presented by the Bishop to the Rectory of Westerfield, a small village 2 miles from Ipswich, where he remained till 1890. In that year he resigned under the Incumbents Resignation Act, and came to live at Soham, Cambridgeshire. He died at Soham, on 7 March 1895, in the house of his only child, John Cyprian Rust, vicar of the parish. He was buried at Westerfield on March 13."

At the same time he accepted the college living of Barrow in Suffolk, to which Dr. Ross, the bishop of Exeter, an intimate friend and patron of Ashby, added the rectory of Stansfield in 1780. In 1793 his sight began to fail, and shortly afterwards he became totally blind. He died of paralysis at Barrow on 12 June 1808, and was buried in the parish church, where a monument was erected to his memory."

But already in 1370, he lost Celle to the Ascanian dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg (Albert and his uncle Wenceslas, Elector of Saxe-Wittemberg), who had been given the principality by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who had also banned Magnus. Several cities, including Luneburg (Lunenburg), Uelzen, and Hanover switched allegiance to the Ascanians; Magnus managed to keep the City of Braunschweig (Brunswick) among his allies only with difficulties. The Luneburg War of Succession continued for several years after Magnus died in the Battle of Leveste (a part of today's Gehrden), near the Deister, on 25 July 1373."

Between 1724 and 1740 he composed 19 operas, and for many years worked at the Imperial Court in Vienna. His best known opera is Cesare in Egitto of 1735. He also wrote a deal of sacred music, including eight psalm settings for tenor and bass, and some concertos with continuo. In 1738 Giacomelli again became Kapellmeister, this time at the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto; he died in Loreto in 1740."

News of Moray's actions quickly drew supporters to him. Alexander Pilchie, a burgess from Inverness, and a number of other burgesses from the town were amongst his earliest supporters. Although Sir Andrew Moray of Petty remained imprisoned in the Tower of London - where he apparently died as King Edward's prisoner - many of his tenants willingly joined his son. Sir William fitz Warin, the English constable of Urquhart Castle on the shores of Loch Ness, wrote to King Edward in July 1297: ``Some evil disposed people have joined Andrew Moray at the castle of Avoch in Ross.''"

His distinctive technique was taught as a standard at the Royal Academy of Music in London. A wonder of modern medical science, he remained a vibrant and energetic educator right until his death on April 19, 1999 in Naples, Florida."

After her mother's death in 1745, she entered an convent and became a nun. She inherited Ekesjo manor in Sweden, but as she had not received royal consent to convert and as she remained in France, her property was sold by her siblings. She died in Paris."

Bock was set to work preparing plates for banknotes, and then to official assignments making portraits of recently executed criminals and of Tasmanian Aborigines. Bock was one of the exhibitors at the first major art exhibition, in Hobart. His official work produced private commissions, and by the time of his death in Hobart, Tasmania, he was a successful portraitist specialising in miniatures. Bock was one of the most highly skilled of the early convict artists. Much of his apparently voluminous output remains lost, or at least unidentified, but he can be credited with two Australian 'firsts': he left behind a small body of nude studies, rare in early colonial art; and he was one of the first in the colonies to experiment with photography."

In the 1490s it is likely he became a priest (although there is no known documentation of that today), and he also may have obtained a master's degree at a university, since he is commonly known as maistre later in his life.

The woodcuts for the contemporary fashion book, De gli Habiti Antichi e Moderni di Diversi Parti di Mondo published in Venice in 1590 by Cesare, in large may belong to Christopher Krieger from Nuremberg. Cesare also published a book of prints depicting the jewels of royal crowns, titled Corona delle nobili e virtuose donne (1591)."

In 1869 Darrall was elected as a Republican Party (United States) Republican to the Forty-first Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses (1969 March 4 - 1877 March 3). He presented credentials as a Member-elect to the Forty-fifth Congress and served from 1877 March 4 to 1878 February 20 when he was succeeded by Democrat Joseph H. Acklen, who had successfully contested the election of 1876. Darrall moved back to Morgan City and did not seek nomination the next year. In 1880, he was elected for the final time to Congress, serving from 1881 March 4 to 1883 March 3 (the 47th Congress). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1882 to the Forty-eighth Congress, being defeated by fellow Republican William Pitt Kellogg. After his service in Congress, Darrall was appointed by President Chester A. Arthur to be Registrar of the United States Land Office in New Orleans from 1883 to 1885. He ran one final time, unsuccessfully, for Congress in 1888. After that, Darrall moved to Washington, D.C., where he died on 1908 January 1. He is interred in Glenwood Cemetery in the District of Columbia."

She was then supported by an older sister. She became a mother's helper in the household of William Augustus Brown who was a Salem ship- holder. In 1854 the Browns moved to Brooklyn, New York. Bridges and her sisters moved with them. She lived with the Browns in order to take care of the children, but she also opened a school with her sisters. Bridges later studied art, after being inspired by sculptress Anne Whitney, at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia with William Trost Richards and became very close to his family . He was a Pre-Raphaelite advocate and her style was greatly influenced by him. After the American Civil War she studied for a year in Europe, but later returned to The United States in the 1860s. This was a time when water coloring was a very respected style and she quickly gained popularity with her exquisite depictions of flowers and birds. She was considered a specialist in her field and focused on the beauty and serenity of small bits of nature. In 1876 many of her paintings were reproduced and sold by publisher and lithographer Louis Prang. This success eventually led to a job as a designer for Prang's firm. For this job Bridges designed Christmas cards and she kept it until 1899. She moved to Connecticut in the early 1890s and led a quiet lifestyle. In her lifetime, Fidelia Bridges became Associate of the National Academy of Design and a member of The American Society of Painters in Watercolor (now The American Watercolor Society). She was the only female artist out of seven famous 19th century American artists in this society. She exhibited her work sporadically from 1863 until 1908. Fidelia Bridges died in 1923 in Canaan, Connecticut at the age of eighty-nine."

He held the position until he was deposed by the church Assembly in 1638, after which he moved to England. While there he obtained a benefice, and in 1661, after the Restoration, he obtained a doctorate from the University of Oxford. In this period he became a prebendary of Westminster. Upon the restoration of Episcopacy in Scotland, he was made Bishop of Aberdeen, receiving consecration on 1 June 1662. He held this position for little over half a year, contracting a mortal fever. He died at Aberdeen in late January 1663, and was buried in the cathedral."

The Bentleys operated a large farm, raising cattle and growing wheat, and Max tended to return to the farm to recuperate during hockey seasons when he felt he needed to rest up. He and his wife Betty had a son, Lynn, who was also a hockey player. Bentley died at his home in Saskatoon on January 19, 1984, at the age of 63."

He was for almost fifty years a liveryman of the Company of Stationers, and spent most of his life in London, living in 1773 in Barnard's Inn, Holborn. In 1784, whilst living in Bernard's Inn, John Noorthouck describes himself as a Freemason. In the book, ``Noorthouck's Masonry'', the Editor ``J.N.'' states in the Preface starting at page vii, ``The present editor esteems it a duty incumbent on him to advertise his bretheren of the general alterations the following work has undergone with a view to improvement.'' The Preface ends with the details, ``May 1, 1784, Bernard's Inn, London''. In 1814 Noorthouck was living at Oundle, Northamptonshire, where he died about July 1816."

His early training started at the age of thirteen in Bergen under Hans Leganger Reuch (1800-1854) . He was educated as a painter in Dusseldorf, but continued his studies in Paris and Munich. Askevold came to Dusseldorf in 1855 and stayed for 3 years. He trained in Dusseldorf under Professor Hans Gude from 1855 until 1859. He was known as a member of the Dusseldorf school with others like Adelsteen Normann. From 1861 to 1866 he was in Paris. In 1866 Askevold moved back to Norway and settled in Bergen. After this he moved back to Dusseldorf where he would spend his winters in Germany and his summers in Norway. Askevold did some commissions for churches in Norway. He died in 1900 in Dusseldorf."

He was said to be ``among the giants of the brotherhood'' (Woods 246). ``G. C.'' Brewer was named for U.S. President Grover Cleveland, ``G. C.'' Brewer is generally known by his initials. G. C. Brewer was born in Giles County, Tennessee; he died in Searcy, Arkansas, on June 9, 1956. He was an author, preacher, and teacher, serving on the faculty of Lipscomb University (then known as David Lipscomb University). His persuasive rhetoric and passionate oratory have been noted along with his uncanny ability to define mainstream Church of Christ doctrine in the mid-20th Century. (His brother, Dr. Charles R. Brewer, was also a notable preacher and a teacher at David Lipscomb University, where to this day a bell tower stands in his honor.) G. C. Brewer was no stranger to controversy, challenging Catholicism and Communism directly and debating frequently; yet he also demonstrated a willingness to change his views, especially those regarding the doctrine of grace."

With the cardinal exiled, Servien was minister of state, de facto governor of France with his nephew Hugues de Lionne and his rival Michel le Tellier. He was made Superintendent of Finances in 1653, conjointly with Nicolas Fouquet. He was an adviser to Mazarin in the negotiations which terminated in the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659). He amassed a considerable fortune, and was unpopular, even in court circles. He died at the Chateau de Meudon, which he had purchased in 1654 and where he had launched ambitious works of rebuilding."

        "snippet": "Gilbert was mostly a place-holder archbishop. His health had begun to deteriorate prior to his appointment and he lived ``through a pontificate of four years, when he sank under a complication of infirmities.'' He died at Twickenham on 9 August 1761, aged 68, and was buried in a vault in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street. Gilbert seems to have possessed few qualifications to justify his high promotion in the church. He was neither a scholar nor a theologian. Nor were these deficiencies compensated by graces of character. A friendly witness, Bishop Newton, speaks of his being regarded as ``somewhat haughty;'' while Horace Walpole, describes him as ``composed of that common mixture of ignorance, meanness, and arrogance.'' John Newton, William Cowper's friend, when seeking to obtain ordination from him, found Gilbert ``inflexible in supporting the rules and canons of the church.'' His imperious character is illustrated by his refusal to allow the civic mace to be carried before the mayor of Salisbury in processions within the cathedral precincts, for which he claimed a separate jurisdiction, disobedience to which, it is said, caused an unseemly personal scuffle between him and the mace-bearer. According to Newton, Gilbert was the first prelate to introduce at confirmations the practice of the bishop laying his hands on each candidate at the altar rails, and then retiring and solemnly pronouncing the prayer once for the whole number. This mode was first observed at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham; it ``commanded attention, and raised devotion,'' and before long became the regular manner of administering the rite."

In the year 1874 Thomae married Anna Uhde in Balgstadt in the proximity of his native city Laucha an der Unstrut. Their son Walter Thomae was born one year later on 5 November 1875, but Thomae's wife died 5 days after giving birth. In 1879 Thomae became ordentliche professor at the University of Jena. In 1892 he married his second wife Sophie Propper in Jena. One year later was born Susanne Thomae. In 1914 Thomae, at that time dean of the philosophical faculty at the University of Jena, retired. In 1921 he died in Jena after a short illness. Carl Johannes Thomae's research was concerned with function theory and with what German-speaking mathematicians often call ``Epsilontik'', the precise development of analysis, differential geometry, and topology using epsilon-neighborhoods in the style of Weierstrass. The Thomae function, the Thomae transformation formula (aka, Thomae's transformation and Thomae's theorem), the Thomae formula for hyperelliptic curves, and the Sears-- Thomae transformation formula are named after him. He called himself Riemann's student, although he never attended a lecture by Riemann."

In 1961 he moved to Pock, where he became the city's chief architect. Although initially a communist and a member of the Polish United Workers' Party, Staszewski's poems were found dangerous by the party's authorities and he was expelled from it. In 1967, through Hungary, Staszewski with his wife emigrated to Paris and then to Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he wrote the majority of his poems. He also recorded some of them as bootleg songs on a tape recorder. He died January 22, 1973 in Paris and was buried at Warsaw's Brodno Cemetery."

        "snippet": "A year or two after Stothard died, Anna Eliza married Edward Atkyns Bray, the vicar of Tavistock. She then began writing novels, and from 1826 to 1874, produced at least a dozen. Some of these, such as The Talba, or the Moor of Portugal dealt with foreign life, but she based her most popular novels on the principal families (the Trelawneys of Trelawne, the Pomeroys, and the Courtenays of Walreddon) of the counties of Devon and Cornwall. They were historical novels, and proved so popular that they were issued in a set of ten volumes by Longmans in 1845-6, and were reprinted by Chapman & Hall as recently as 1884. Her second husband died in 1857, and Mrs. Bray then removed to London, where she selected and edited some of her late husband's poetry and sermons, and then returned to original work. Her last years were embittered by a report that during a visit to Bayeux in 1816, she stole a piece of that city's famous tapestry. However, her character was cleared by correspondence and leading articles that appeared in the Times. After a long life in literary labours, she died in London on 21 Jan. 1883. Her autobiography, to 1843, was published by her nephew, Mr. John A. Kempe, in 1884--but it is sketchy, and less than accurate. It depicts an accomplished and kindly woman, proud of her own creations, and enthusiastic in praise of the literary characters she knew."

After several years in the Union Army, he moved briefly to Covington, Kentucky and the Cincinnati, Ohio area. On Christmas Day, 1866, at age 20, he married Cornelia Blanche Hall in Wheeling. After Cornelia's death in 1881, William B. Ebbert and his three children (Blanche, Edith, and William) moved to the Pueblo, Colorado area and took up farming. He soon met and married Catherine Scheutle in 1884 in Pueblo. William and Catherine produced three more boys in Colorado; all died at prematurely. In Colorado, Ebbert established himself as a community leader, author, and politician. He served several years in the Colorado Legislature, representing Dolores, Otero, Pueblo, and Montezuma counties. Legendary railroad chieftain Otto Mears bestowed upon Ebbert one of his rare silver railroad passes in 1889 (Silverton Railroad Pass No. 193). After a respected life in the military, agriculture, and politics, William B. Ebbert died on February 27, 1927 in Cortez, Colorado. It was just one day before his 81st birthday. He is buried at the Lewis Cemetery, a few miles north of Cortez, Colorado."

In February 1811 he wrote to Robert Peel, Under-secretary of state for the colonies, suggesting that he should succeed Collins as lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land. This was subsequently rejected as it was believed that as a naval officer he could not command troops. In 1812-16 he served in the Salsette on the India Station. Returning to England on 13 May 1825, he married Elizabeth Clowes. After a long illness he died at Ilfracombe."

He was on his honeymoon in 1970, when he was unexpectedly terminated by Mayor Joseph Alioto who appointed Alfred Nelder as San Francisco Police Chief. Chief Cahill was totally blindsided by Mayor Alioto's move. Alioto felt Cahill was too ``rigid'' and ``old fashioned'' for law enforcement in 1970s San Francisco. This was indeed a shame, as Cahill loved, lived, and breathed the SFPD. While Al Nelder was a good chief and an honorable man, he was not the iconic figure that Tom Cahill was. After Chief Cahill's termination he became Chief of Security for Pac Bell in San Francisco and eventually retired. He died October 12, 2002 in Lake County at Queen of the Valley Hospital in Clearlake Park, California. He was survived by four children and many grandchildren. His favorite grandchild was Shannon, his Munecita Linda."

Originally, he wanted to become a publisher and founded a company called ``Phoebus'' in order to promote his third book. But after some time, the firm changed its field of operation and went into construction works. Phoebus built state-subsidized homes for working-class families and Richard Muller acted very successfully as director of the enterprise. By 1930 he had become a millionaire, some time later he left the business and retired. Little is known about his late years, he did not seem to be active in any kind of anti-fascist action, at least nothing like this is documented. Muller died on 11 May 1943 in Berlin."

In 1736 he was in Maastricht, but by 1738 he had moved with his wife Susanna Maria Knopffell and their son to Antwerp where they became members of the Reformed church. He became an alderman in 1744, and lived in Hopland. He travelled to England in 1750 to sell two of his harpsichords. His will left all his harpsichord-making material to his son Joannes Dulcken; he died in Antwerp. He left a good reputation behind: Charles Burney claimed that, after the Ruckers family, 'the harpsichord-maker of the greatest eminence ... was J. D. Dulcken'."

When this subsided he helped expose Titus Oates, and with the Revolution of 1688, he veered towards the Whig party. Having lost the confidence of both sides, ``recanting Settle'' abandoned politics for the appointment (1691) of city poet. In his old age he kept a booth at Bartholomew Fair, where he is said to have played the part of the dragon in a green leather suit devised by himself. He became a poor brother of the Charterhouse, where he died."

        "snippet": "He was arrested in October 2002 and sentenced to five years in prison for stating at a 'People's Conference' in Tripoli that reform in Libya would require a constitution, free speech and democracy. He was briefly released in March 2004 after U.S. Senator Joe Biden met with Gaddafi, and then re-imprisoned after calling for democratization of Libya in a television interview. In early 2004 he, his wife, and his eldest son were taken into custody. The Libyan government claimed that Eljahmi was put on trial in late 2005, accused of the capital charges of ``trying to overthrow the government, insulting Col. Gaddafi and contacting foreign authorities, after he talked to a US diplomat.'' During her visit to Libya, the American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pleaded for Eljahmi's release from solitary detention. Eljahmi remained imprisoned. ElJahmi died on 21 May 2009 in Amman, Jordan, where he had been evacuated for emergency medical treatment after he fell into a coma in Libyan custody."

He soon gave up his legal studies for theology, and in 1687 became minister of a Presbyterian congregation at Chester. He moved again in 1712 to Mare Street, Hackney. Two years later (22 June 1714), he died suddenly of apoplexy at the Queen's Aid House (41 High Street) in Nantwich while on a journey from Chester to London."

He was born at Ghent in 1663, and was first a scholar of Francis van Mierhop, but he afterwards studied under Hans van Cleef. When he was twenty-two years of age he went to Rome, where he became a disciple of Carlo Maratti. Under this master he became a good painter of historical subjects. He amused himself with the point in his leisure moments, and some of his plates were shown to Carlo Maratti, who recommended him to devote himself entirely to the art of engraving. He, however, painted several pictures for the churches of his native city, to which he returned after an absence, it is said, of thirty-seven years. He died at Ghent in 1748. His best work is the altar-piece of the high altar in the church of the Carthusians at Ghent, representing 'St. Peter appearing to a group of Monks of that order. ' In the church of St. James is a picture by him of 'St. Catharine refusing to worship the False Gods. ' Several other works by this master are in the churches and convents of his native city, all of which are painted in the style of C. Maratti."

He was the son of a goldsmith, who intended to bring him up to his own profession, but his father died when he was very young, and his mother permitted him to indulge the inclination he had shown for art. He was at first placed under the care of Louis van der Bosch, under whom he studied for two years, and then entered the school of Caspar Jacobus van Opstal. He painted historical subjects and conversations; in the former, he adopted the style of Richard van Orley, and in the latter imitated that of the younger Teniers. His works were held in the highest estimation, and he was loaded with commissions, not only for the collections of Brabant and Flanders, but also for those of Holland. When not more than twenty years of age he was received into the Academy at Antwerp, and was considered one of the ablest artists of his time. He was much employed in embellishing the saloons of the principal mansions, and in painting the ceilings of the public edifices. One of his most admired performances was a saloon and ceiling, representing the ' History of Pandora,' painted for the family of Hasselaer, in 1740. He died at Antwerp in 1747."

He joined the Society of Jesus, became a missionary, and as such began about 1701 to travel through the territories of Quillota, Polpaico, Tiltil, Limache, and others. From 1712 until 1720 he directed the missions of Nahuelhuapi and Calbuco, and in 1730 he was in Concepcion during the earthquake of July, which destroyed that city. His frequent voyages gave him an opportunity to study the archives of the Company of Jesus, and about 1736, in Santiago, he began to compile his history. From 1740 till 1758 he served in the missions of Araucania, where he learned the language of the Indians. He intended to write a complete history of Chile, when a decree of Charles III exiled the Jesuits, and, notwithstanding his advanced age, Olivares had to leave the country. In Lima, by order of the viceroy, Manuel de Amat, he was robbed of his manuscripts, and the viceroy's secretary, Jose Perfecto Salas, obtained the second part of the ``Historia militar, civil y sagrada de lo acaecido en la conquista y pacificacion del Reino de Chile.'' From Imola he tried to recover his manuscripts, and the king himself ordered the president of Chile to send them to Spain, which was done by Ambrosio O'Higgins, but Olivares died at Imola before their arrival in Madrid. A complete edition of the work and a ``Historia de la Compania de Jesus en Chile 1593--1736,'' with notes by the Chilean historian Diego Barros Arana, appeared in Santiago in 1870."

Hitov was a band leader in the Serbian-Turkish War of 1876 and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. After the Liberation in 1878, Hitov lived in Rousse, taking part in the political life. In 1878, he headed the Unification of Bulgaria in his native Sliven. Later, due to his opposition to Stefan Stambolov's regime (1887--1894), he was sent to prison.

Although he was instructed by his father in engraving, he did not follow his example, either in the style of his execution, or in the size of his plates. He appears to have studied and to have formed his manner from the works of Lucas van Leyden. His compositions are abundant, but he wanted taste in the selection of his forms. He finished his plates very neatly with the graver; but there is not much effect in his prints, from his ignorance of the management of the chiaroscuro. Notwithstanding this defect, which was very general at the time in which he lived, his works possess considerable merit. He died at Amsterdam in 1656. He signed his plates sometimes with his initials N. de B., and sometimes with a monogram."

Sebastiano received a canonicate at Turin Cathedral in 1520, but he died at Rome on 31 July 1524."

He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1837, and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1852, and in 1844 took the London M.D. In 1847 he began at the London Fever Hospital investigations into cases of continued fever which enabled him finally to make the distinction between typhus and typhoid on which his reputation as a pathologist principally rests. In 1849 he was appointed professor of pathological anatomy at University College, and also assistant physician to University College Hospital, where he afterwards became physician (1854-1876) and consulting physician (1879), besides holding similar appointments at other hospitals. He was also successively Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine and professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College London. He was president of the Royal College of Physicians (1881-1888); was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1864, and received honorary degrees from the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, and University of Edinburgh. In 1861 he was appointed Physician Extraordinary, and in 1862 Physician in Ordinary, to Queen Victoria, and in 1863 Physician in Ordinary to the Prince of Wales; he attended both the prince consort and the prince of Wales in their attacks of typhoid fever. In 1868 he was created a baronet. As a consultant, Sir William Jenner had a great reputation, and he left a large fortune when he died, at Bishop's Waltham, Hants, on 11 December 1898, having then retired from practice for eight years owing to failing health."

He is perhaps best known for his series of musical revues, Leonard Sillman's New Faces, which introduced many major stars to Broadway audiences, such as Eartha Kitt, Inga Swenson, Paul Lynde and Maggie Smith. Versions of New Faces were produced in 1934, 1936, 1943, 1952, 1956, 1962 and 1968. The very first New Faces in 1934 included actors Henry Fonda, Imogene Coca and Frances Dewey Wormser. Songwriter Arthur Siegel, who contributed many songs to the New Faces series and radio show, described Sillman's philosophy: ``He believed that a revue should be a potpourri, a bouillabaisse, in which there was something for everyone. Pace was very important. He didn't want to give an audience a chance to think about what it just saw. The music had to be nonstop.'' Sillman also produced many other plays from the 1930s into the late 1960s, including All in Fun (1940), Mask and Gown (1957) and the Family Way (1965). His autobiography Here Lies Leonard Sillman: Straightened Out at Last was published by the Citadel Press in 1959. Sillman died on January 23, 1982 in New York City."

Ross began her novel Oreo hoping for a career in writing, and it was published in 1974 at the height of the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Ross wrote articles for magazines such as Essence, Titters and Playboy, and then got work on The Richard Pryor Show. She was unable to complete a second novel, due to difficulties supporting herself on this work. She worked in media and publishing until she died on September 17, 1985 in New York City."

Buchanan was also the author of many successful plays, including Lady Clare, produced in 1883, Sophia (1886), an adaptation of Tom Jones; A Man's Shadow (1890), and The Charlatan (1894). He also wrote, in collaboration with Harriett Jay, the melodrama Alone in London. His latest poems, The Outcast: a Rhyme for the Time (1891) and The Wandering Jew (1893) were directed against certain aspects of Christianity. In 1896 he became, so far as some of his work was concerned, his own publisher. He was unfortunate in his latter years; a speculation turned out ruinously, and he had to sell his copyrights. In the autumn of 1900 he had a paralytic seizure, from which he never recovered. He died at Streatham."

        "snippet": "Shirley Ximena Hopper Russell (1886--1985), also known as Shirley Marie Russell, was an American artist best known for her paintings of Hawaii and her still lifes of Hawaiian flowers. She was born Shirley Ximena Hopper in Del Rey, California, in 1886. She graduated in 1907 from Stanford University, where she discovered art. Shirley married Lawrence Russell, an engineer, in 1909. When he died in 1912, she began teaching in Palo Alto, and dabbling in painting. In 1921, she and her son came to Hawaii for a visit and decided to stay. She studied under Hawaiian artist Lionel Walden during the 1920s and traveling to Europe several times to further her art education. She studied in Paris during the 1930s and the cubist influence can be seen in a number of her works. She taught art at President William McKinley High School in Honolulu for more than 20 years. Around 1935-1936, the Japanese publisher Watanabe Shozaburo (1885--1962) published several woodblock prints she designed. The majority of these prints depict colorful and detailed tropical flowers, while at least one print, Carmel Mission, is a California landscape. In the course of her art career, Russell had three one-woman exhibitions at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, and taught art at the University of Hawaii and the Honolulu Academy of Arts. She launched many young artists on their careers when they were her students at McKinley High School, including Satoru Abe (1926-) and John Chin Young (1909--1997). Although she painted in representational style herself, she was a staunch supporter of abstract art. She continued to paint almost daily until her death in Honolulu in 1985, at the age of 98. The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, the Hawaii State Art Museum and the Honolulu Academy of Arts are among the public collections holding works by Shirley Ximena Hopper Russell."

Ferguson also served as an officer in the local militia and became a lieutenant-colonel in 1865, participating in the defense against the Fenian raids. He was elected to both the Ontario legislature and the House of Commons in 1867 and was reelected by acclamation to the provincial assembly in 1872. In the same year, he was struck on the head while attempting to stop a fight at a political meeting at Bradford and was forced to resign his seat in 1873 due to incapacity. He was appointed customs collector at Collingwood but was dismissed in 1876 after the Liberals came into power. He died at Cookstown in 1879."

Withdrawing from Oxford, he retired, in the first instance, to Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, and he ministered in various parishes around. After the Act of Uniformity 1662 he was silenced, like other nonconformists, but he seems, after remaining at Rickmansworth about two years longer, to have lived in private families, and to have exercised his ministerial functions covertly and in defiance of the law. According to the Rev. Robert Watts, Staunton became pastor of a meeting-house at Salters' Hall, London, built for him. His last move was to Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, where, and at towns such as St. Albans, he preached to small groups. He died at Bovingdon on 14 July 1671, and was buried in the parish church."

He spent the winters of 1831 and 1832 in Rome. Afterwards, he resided for nearly a decade in Boston, Massachusetts, where he had considerable vogue, and where he painted a portrait of Charles Dickens (1842). He died in 1881 in Florence. There is a tradition that when Dickens visited Boston, a line of New England portraitists was already fawning on shore, hoping to be the first to capture the great novelist's image on canvas. But Francis Alexander reached the writer well ahead of his peers--by traveling in a small advance boat to greet Dickens as his vessel entered the harbor. Longfellow would later coin the verb Alexandered (as in, whangled), sniffing that such and such a person had Alexandered his way into a highly coveted invitation to a party."

Sometime before 1834 he took up residence in Islington. Though a comment in his 1834 book on geology suggests that he was still a member of the Church of England, shortly after moving to Islington he became the pastor of a Methodist chapel, the Islington Green Chapel. (In 1840 it was taken over by Baptists renamed Providence Chapel.) About 1840 Cole returned to a clerical position in the Church of England and from as early as 1841 until 1857 he was the ``Sunday evening lecturer'' and curate at the small St. Mary's Somerset Church, Upper Thames Street, London,' a task which involved him in ``unceasing engagements in the instruction of youth.'' Having struggled for much of his life with ill health, he died in Islington on June 29, 1858, at the age of 66, after two recent spells of paralysis."

In 1915, he traveled to Georgia to explore the Nacoochee Mound in the state's old Cherokee region. In 1917, as a result of this exploration, Pepper published The Nacoochee Mound Report. From 1896 to 1900, George Pepper led the excavation of the Pueblo Bonito great house in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.

        "snippet": "In 1855 Newton declined the regius professorship of Greek at Oxford. In 1860 he was made British consul at Rome, but had scarcely entered upon the post when an opportunity presented itself of reorganizing the amorphous department of antiquities at the British Museum, which was divided into three and ultimately four branches. The Greek and Roman section naturally fell to Newton, who returned as Keeper, and held the office until 1885, declining the offer of the principal librarianship made to him in 1878. The Mausoleum Room, to accommodate the treasures he had found in Asia Minor, was built under his supervision, but the most brilliant episode of his administration was the acquisition of the Blacas and Castellani gems and sculptures. The Farnese and Pourtals collections were also acquired by him. He took a leading part in the foundation of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, the British School at Athens, and the Egypt Exploration Fund. He was Yates professor of classical archaeology at University College, London, from 1880 to 1888. His collected Essays on Art and Archaeology were published in 1886. When, on his retirement from the Museum, his bust by Boehm, now placed in one of the sculpture galleries, was presented to him as a testimonial, he desired the unexpended balance to be given to the school at Athens. After his retirement he was much occupied with the publication of the Greek inscriptions in the British Museum, but his health failed greatly in the latter years of his life. He died at Margate. He married in 1861 the daughter of his successor in the consulate at Rome, the painter Joseph Severn; she was Ann Mary Newton, herself a distinguished artist. She died in 1866."

His ship, however, was captured by the French and Spaniards, by whom he was brought to Lisbon, where he died in 1782.

In his will, he left legacies to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps. Oddly enough, his official seal included a head of the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments."

Poor Arthur had a slight attack of Ague-- which he had often had-- Order'd his fire to be lighted-- and talked with as much cheerfulness as usual-- He suddenly became insensible, and his Spirit departed without Pain-- The Physician endeavour'd to get any Blood from him--and on Examination it was the General Opinion that he could not have lived long-- This was also Dr Holland's opinion-- The account I have endeavour'd to give you, is merely what I have been able to gather, but the family of course are in too great distress to enter into details--"

Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support. He became well-known and well-respected in Japanese society. After Ashikaga Yoshinori became Shogun, he became hostile toward Zeami. Yoshinori held Zeami's nephew Onnami in high regard, and disagreed with Zeami's refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe. Possibly due to this disagreement, though a variety of competing theories have been advanced, Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to Sado Island. After Yoshinori's death, Zeami returned to mainland Japan, where he died in 1443."

He showed strong Presbyterian views during the civil war, with, however, an attachment to the king, and in 1651 he was imprisoned briefly with some other ministers for his share in Christopher Love's plot to recall Charles II of England. He was released on 30 June 1652, and was formally reinstated as vicar of St. Stephen's Walbrook. He obtained great fame and popularity as a preacher until the Restoration, when he was ejected for nonconformity. Notwithstanding the rigor of the acts against dissenters, Watson continued to exercise his ministry privately as he found opportunity. Upon the Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 he obtained a license to preach at the great hall in Crosby House. After preaching there for several years, his health gave way, and he retired to Barnston, Essex, where he died suddenly while praying in secret. He was buried on 28 July 1686.http://www.fivesolas.com/watson/wattarget.htm"

Oddly, Melfi's body was somehow misplaced by hospital staff, only to be found four month's later in a potter's grave. After weeks of red tape his brother John Melfi had Leonards body exhumed and brought to Campbell Funeral Home in NYC. It was there the pine box was opened and John was able to verify that it was his brother Leonard. He then had Leonard transferred to DeMarco Funeral Home in Binghamton, N.Y. and after a complete funeral service including a mass he was buried in a family plot next to his sister In April, 2002. Memorial services were also held for the playwright on Sunday, May 5, 2002 at La Mama, following an April 17, article, published by the New York Times, describing the playwright's desperate and lonely final days. Although he was unable to attend personally, playwright Edward Albee sent the following note which was read to the many who were present:"

From 1869 to 1871 he pursued literary studies at Munster. When the Jesuits were expelled from Germany, in 1872, Kreiten was sent to Aix-en-Provence, where he completed his theological studies and was ordained priest on 8 June 1873. From 1870 to 1878 he was on the editorial staff of Stimmen aus Maria Laach in Tervuren near Brussels. In 1878 ill-heath compelled him to retire to Kerkrade, where he spent the remaining twenty-three years of his life in literary pursuits. He was one of the chief workers on Stimmen aus Maria Laach, to which he contributed numerous essays on literary subjects and most of the reviews of contemporary Catholic literature from 1874 to 1902."

He wrote books on Czech and German nationalism, on social justice, on the fundamental differences between the West and the East and very early against the misuse of racial theories and against antisemitism. Together with the Protestant theologian J. L. Hromadka he co-founded the Czech Academic YMCA and published numerous booklets on various public topics. In 1934 he presided the 8th International Congress of Philosophy in Prague, but after 1935 he was gradually excluded from public life by a serious illness. He died in 1942 in Prague during the German occupation in almost complete isolation. His posthumous book Consolation from Philosophy, in the oppressive mood of war, is a highly personal profession of faith in the lasting values of truth and religion and evoked a lively discussion after its publication in 1946."

        "snippet": "Laura Zirbes (April 26, 1884, Buffalo, New York - June 9, 1967, Columbus, Ohio) was an American educator. Zirbes was a vital figure in education and reading instruction. Zirbes began her teaching career at an elementary school in Cleveland from 1903 to 1919, and then went on to work at the experimental Lincoln School at Teachers College, Columbia University from 1920 until 1926. She finally earned her doctoral degree from Columbia University in 1928. In the years leading up to her retirement (1928-1954) she taught at Ohio State University. In all her teaching years combined, she taught for 61 years, including summer sessions until 1964. During so many years of teaching, Zirbes endured some of the most important issues affecting education in the United States throughout the twentieth century. In Cleveland, she taught a class of fifty-six fourth graders that were all children of immigrants. During her time at Columbia, she listened to Edward L. Thorndike, John Dewey, and William Bagley discuss the value of testing, and heard Bagley argue with William Heard Kilpatrick about Kilpatrick's Project method. Zirbes coauthored many articles with William S. Gray. Her dissertation made her one of the country's experts on teaching children to read. She never really considered herself an expert at reading because she did not believe in isolating one subject from other subjects. Zirbes founded the laboratory school at Ohio State, this school continued under her influence for over thirty years. She believed children learned things best when their interest was high. Zirbes supported the child-centered approach only if the teacher had a good understanding of the skills she wanted the children to learn, and carefully lead her class in that direction. The next step in learning was to provide good learning experiences that would enlarge children's understanding and their vocabulary. Zirbes believed that numerous other elements contribute to learning. The first, that the lesson should be meaningful to the child, and second, that learning should be intrinsically motivating. The final two elements of learning, as Zirbes saw it, were that the lesson should stimulate thinking and lastly it should be integrated with other subjects. As Zirbes neared retirement, critics like Arthur Bestor attacked her beliefs on education. Her answer to this criticism came in the form of a book, Spurs to Creative Teaching (1959). She died on June 9, 1967 in Columbus, Ohio."

        "snippet": "His political associates in Trenton were amazed with his astonishing capacity for work. He seemed to thrive on long, drawn-out legislative sessions and party caucuses. He never tired of them and he never complained. He worked long hours in the state house before and after state sessions, frequently forgetting to eat or sleep. In 1916 Mr. Godfrey created a political sensation by announcing that he was a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. To seek support for his candidacy, he staged a dinner at the Traymore Hotel that was attended by prominent politicians and businessmen throughout New Jersey, but the nomination eventually went to the leading contender, Walter Evans Edge, also of Atlantic County, who subsequently was elected the 36th Governor of New Jersey. Mr. Godfrey was known for his outstanding real estate and shore development accomplishments. He directed the movement that obtained five miles of Atlantic City ocean front for park purposes and secured the necessary legislation. His leadership is credited with building the lower beach boardwalk, creating many blocks of new beach front, and the building of the then Margate City Parkway and Somers Point-Longport boulevard. Mr. Godfrey and his wife Annie lived in Atlantic City and raised four sons, Carlton Jr., Samual, Philip, and Russell. He died on February 26, 1929 at his home in Atlantic City at the age of 64 after a long illness."

He published, however, in 1792, ''A Plan of a course of lectures. `` The museum was considerably enriched by him. He married, and retired to the vicarage of Trumpington, near Cambridge, in 1818, and worked zealously for the education of the poor of his parish. He devoted much attention to chemistry and mineralogy, as well as to his favourite science, and kept for many years a meteorological diary. He made additions to the Woodwardian Museum, and left manuscript journals of his travels at home and abroad, and much correspondence on geological subjects. He was elected to the Linnean Society in 1800, and to the Royal Society in 1801, and was one of the original members of the Geological Society. Hailstone contributed papers to the ''Transactions of the Geological Society`` (1816, iii. 243--50), the ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society`` (1822, i. 453--8), and the British Association (Report, 1834, p. 569).

The Byzantines' Mongol allies belonging to the horde of Nogai Khan met with some more success, plundering Thessaly shortly afterwards. Michael VIII died in 1282 while preparing to invade Thessaly again. The triumph of the anti-Unionists with the accession of Andronikos II Palaiologos created the potential for improving relations, but this possibility was ruined by John's half-brother, Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas of Epirus. In 1283 or 1284 Nikephoros and his wife Anna Kantakouzene (the niece of Michael VIII) invited John's son Michael to Epirus to marry their daughter and become the heir to their state. When Michael took the bait, he was arrested and shipped off to Constantinople, where he died in prison in 1307. John took his revenge by invading Epirus and seizing several coastal fortresses. He died in or shortly before 1289."

He was educated at Appleby-in-Westmorland and at St John's College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1709. Ordained a deacon in 1717, he obtained a curacy at Rothbury, Northumberland to one of his uncles, also John Thomlinson (1651--ca 1726), who was rector there. He remained at Rothbury after his uncle's death in 1720, and in 1721, for unknown reasons, he moved to Navestock, Essex. The following year he was appointed rector of Glenfield, Leicestershire, doubtless thanks to his marriage to Catherine Winstanley, the daughter of his patron, James Winstanley of Braunston, Rutland. Thomlinson held this post until his death in Glenfield on 5 February 1761."

In the House of Commons he defended the king's right to levy impositions, and other events of his secretaryship were the inquiry into the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury and the release of Raleigh in 1616. Raleigh was urged by Winwood to attack the Spanish fleet and the Spanish settlements in South America, and the secretary's share in this undertaking was the subject of complaints on the part of the representatives of Spain. In the midst of this he died in London. It can hardly be doubted, says Gardiner, that, if he had lived till the following summer, he would have shared in Raleigh's ruin. One of Winwood's daughters, Anne (d. 1643), married Edward Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton, and their son was Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu."

        "snippet": "Barnard was the son of the Rev. William Barnard of Water Stratford, Bucks, and great-grandson of William Barnard, bishop of Derry, was born at Wedbury, Oxfordshire, in 1799. He was educated at Westminster and Sandhurst, and obtained a commission in the grenadier guards in 1814. He served on the staff of his uncle, Sir Andrew Francis Barnard during the occupation of Paris, and afterwards on that of Sir John Keane in Jamaica. Later he was with his battalion in Canada, and filled various staff appointments at home. A newly made major-general, Barnard landed in the Crimea in 1854, in command of a brigade of the 3rd, or Sir Richard England's, division of the army, with which he was present during the winter of 1854--5. When General Simpson succeeded to the chief command on the death of Lord Raglan, Barnard became his chief of the staff, a position he held at the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855. Afterwards he commanded the 2nd division of the army in the Crimea. After brief periods of command at Corfu, Dover, and Shorncliffe, Barnard was appointed to the staff in Bengal, and reached Umballa, to take over the Sirhind division, towards the end of April 1857, when rumours of impending mischief were gathering fast. On 10 May occurred the outbreaks at Meerut and Delhi, the vague tidings of which reaching Umballa were at once sent on by Barnard, and gave the first warning of actual revolt to the commander-in-chief, General Anson, then at Simla. Upon Anson's death at Kurnaul a fortnight later, Barnard received in charge the scanty force available for the movement against Delhi, and at its head he struck a heavy blow at the mutineers, at Budlee-ke-Serai, on 8 June following, taking up his position on the ridge commanding the north-west front of the city of Delhi the same evening. The value of this victory, as the historian Kaye has truly said, was not to be measured by returns of killed and wounded or captured ordnance. ''It gave us an admirable base of operations--a commanding military position--open in the rear to the lines along which thenceforth our reinforcements and supplies and all that we looked for to aid us in the coming struggle were to be brought. And, great as this gain was to us in a military sense, the moral effect was scarcely less; for behind the ridge lay the old cantonments, from which a month before the British had fled for their lives. On the parade-ground the British head-quarters were now encamped, and the familiar flag of the Feringhees was again to be seen from the houses of the imperial city. `` Four weeks of desultory and unprofitable fighting followed, the strength of the mutineers in the city--strangely under-estimated in most other quarters at the time--being to Barnard's force as six to one in men and four to one in guns. And then, like his predecessor Anson, Barnard was stricken down at his post by the pestilence that was among the British ranks. He died of cholera on 5 July 1857, eleven weeks before the fall of the city, leaving behind him the name of an officer, skilful, if little versed in Indian warfare, and a brave and chivalrous gentleman."

He appeared as a pirate in the West Indies about 1675, and for twenty years was the terror of the Spaniards in Africa and America. He established his headquarters in the island of Tortuga, which at that time was the rendezvous of all the buccaneers. Montauband frequently ravaged the coasts of New Spain, Cartagena, Florida, and North America, as far as Newfoundland. In 1694 he escorted to France a great number of prizes that he had taken in the West Indies, but the excesses that were committed by his crew at Bordeaux forced him to abandon that port in January 1695, and he cruised for some time on the coast of Guinea, capturing many ships from the Dutch and English. After nearly losing his life by the explosion of a powder magazine he returned to Tortuga, but resolved to abandon his mode of life, and returned to Bordeaux, where he died. He wrote Relation du voyage du sieur de Montauband, capitaine de flibustiers sur les cotes de l'Amerique du Sud et de Guinee dans les annees de 1694 et 1695, which is printed in the collection of Las Casas (Amsterdam, 1698). This is considered unauthentic by some authorities."

He was elected to the Ontario legislature in an 1873 by-election held after John Coyne died. He was also a director of the Central Bank of Canada. He owned quarries in the Credit River valley which supplied stone used to build the Ontario Legislature in Toronto. In 1880, he invested in the local Haggert Foundry and became vice-president. However, by 1891, both the bank and the foundry had failed and Chisholm was forced to sell his mansion, now a Royal Canadian Legion hall in Brampton. He was appointed registrar for Peel County in 1892 and held that post until his death in Brampton in 1906."

He is also stated to have been in favour of granting relief to the clergy, who in 1772 petitioned against subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles. He published in 1782 a pamphlet called Hints Respecting some of the University Officers, of which a second edition appeared in 1802. Latin poems by him occur among the congratulatory verses published by the university in 1761 on the occasion of the marriage of George III in 1762, on the birth of a Prince of Wales, and in 1763 on the restoration of peace. Plumptre died at Norwich on 29 October 1788. There is a tablet to his memory on the south side of the presbytery."

Several other Mexican men also attempted to involve themselves, but backed away when several citizens entered, having heard the gunshots from the street."

He dedicated to his former chief a book (Jules Ferry, 1903), which is a valuable testimony to the efforts made by France to organize public education and found a colonial empire; but this fidelity alsc won him some enemies, who succeeded for some time in preventing him from becoming a member of the Institute. He was finally elected a member of the Academie des Sciences morales et politiques on December 11, 1897, in place of the duc d'Aumale, of whose life he wrote an account (vol. xxii., 2nd series, of the Memoires of this academy). His many interests ended by wearing out even his robust constitution, and he died at Paris in 1905."

He was appointed a music examiner at the University of Toronto in 1896 and that same year was made music director of the Kingston Ladies' College. Sometime during the first decade of the 20th century he joined the faculty of the Chicago Musical College where he was actively teaching up through 1912. After this his whereabouts and activities are unknown, although scholars believe he most likely remained in the United States until his death."

Papin articled in law with Joseph-Ferreol Pelletier and was called to the bar in 1846. He helped found the Institut canadien de Montreal in 1844 and served as president in 1847. Papin also contributed to the newspaper L'Avenir. Papin signed the Montreal Annexation Manifesto of 1849 and took part in the movement lobbying for the abolition of seigneurial tenure. He served on the municipal council for Montreal in 1853 and 1854. In 1854, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for L'Assomption and supported the parti rouge. During his time in the assembly, he proposed the creation of a school system that was not based on religious denominations. He was defeated in 1858 and returned to the practice of law. He married Sophie, the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Homier, a member of the municipal council, in 1857. In 1858, he became counsel for the town of Montreal. He died of cancer at L'Assomption in 1862 and was buried at Montreal."

His life philosophy was 'Remember to play after every storm! ' and his motto was: 'Think Gently, Speak Gently, Live Gently'. He wanted to be remembered as ``a poet, a peacemaker, and a philosopher who played''."

Johnston later married Mary Kelly. Johnston died at Falmouth, England after taking a sea voyage on the advice of his physician."

        "snippet": "Ritson spared no pains himself to ensure accuracy in the texts of old songs, ballads and metrical romances which he edited. His collection of the Robin Hood ballads is perhaps his greatest single achievement. Sir Walter Scott, who admired his industry and accuracy in spite of his temper, was almost the only man who could get on with him. According to Scott, Ritson was ``a man of acute observation, profound research, and great labour.'' On one occasion, when he called in Scott's absence, he spoke so rudely to his wife that he was threatened with being thrown out of the window. Spelling was one of his eccentricities, his own name being an example: Ritson is short for Richardson. As early as 1796, Ritson showed signs of mental collapse, and on 10 September 1803 he became completely insane, barricaded himself in his chambers at Gray's Inn, made a bonfire of manuscripts, and was finally forcibly removed to Hoxton, where he died."

He learned to run messages between the rear headquarters and the front lines, and provided early warning of incoming shells. Rags achieved great notoriety and celebrity war dog fame when he saved many lives in the Meuse-Argonne Campaign by delivering a vital message despite being bombed, gassed and partially blinded. His adopted owner and handler, Private James Donovan, was seriously wounded and gassed, dying after returning to a military hospital at Fort Sheridan in Chicago. Rags was adopted by the family of Major Raymond W. Hardenberg there in 1920, moving with them through several transfers until in Fort Hamilton, New York, he was reunited with members of the 18th Infantry Regiment who had known him in France."

The obituary is in the March 24, 1870 San Francisco Chronicle on page 4. Sherrod Williams had followed his son, Thomas Hansford Williams, to California. Thomas Hansford Williams, a lawyer also, had become quite wealthy and resided early on at Coloma, ElDorado County, California where his home has been restored and put on the historical list in 2005. Sherrod Williams is buried in the Colma Cemetery, San Mateo County, California. Rep.

This was a popular work and, coupled with his ability as a preacher, seems to have helped him to be appointed as rector of St. Stephen Coleman Street in 1678. He became lecturer of St Olave, Southwark, in 1683. Whilst his weak eyesight soon failed completely, he nonetheless wrote Enquiry after Happiness (1685), his most famous work. Other publications included The Duty of Servants (1685). In 1697, he was appointed to a prebend at Westminster Abbey and, in 1701, became president of Sion College. He died at Westminster on 29 June 1715 and was buried in the abbey."

Somigliana was called to Turin in 1903 to become the Chair of Mathematical Physics. He held the post until his retirement in 1935, and moved to live in Milan. During the World War II, his apartment in Milan was destroyed. After the war he retreated to his family villa in Casanova Lanza and stayed active in research until near his death in 1955."

Even more amazing was the fact that his opponent was wearing headgear. Johnson was not. He ran marathons across the United States and around the world. He was awarded the Presidential Award for Physical Fitness by President Ronald Reagan. One of his books, entitled A Dud at 70, A Stud at 80: How To Do It features a cover with Johnson, 80, and his thirty-something girlfriend. Johnson died at his home in San Diego on January 21, 1996. He was survived by a son and daughter in San Diego, 3 grandchildren, 9 great grandchildren, and 1 great great grandchild."

Having saved up a small sum of money he entered the Lancasterian University, at Ithaca, in New York State. After a thorough course of study there returned to the village where his parents resided, and entered the office of a law firm, where he read law for two years, supporting himself by teaching. He subsequently entered the office of Judge Collins, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, with whom he read law for another year. Feeling himself qualified for the legal profession, he applied for admission to the Bar; but so great was the existing prejudice against African Americans that the Committee refused to examine him."

His first contribution to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy, a St John in the Wilderness, appeared at Somerset House in 1806, and from that year onwards Geddes was a fairly constant exhibitor of figure-subjects and portraits. His well-known portrait of David Wilkie, with whom he was on terms of intimacy, was at the Royal Academy in 1816. He alternated for some years between London and Edinburgh, with some excursions on the Continent, but in 1831 settled in London, and was elected associate of the Royal Academy in 1832; and he died in London of consumption in 1844."

Elizabeth was many years Crosdill's senior and her comfortable income from interests in Wiltshire, allowed him to retire from public performance. He did, however, perform two years at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester and the coronation of George IV on 19 July 1821. His wife, who died in 1807, bequeathed all her estates to her surviving sisters, with Crosdill's name only mentioned in the probate note. Sources give conflicting information about his death in early October 1825. Most say he died in Escrick, Yorkshire, at the home of a nephew of his friend Beilby Thompson. Others maintain that he died at his house in London."

He left Halle in 1769, to become second pastor of the church of the Holy Spirit at Magdeburg, where he passed the happiest part of his professional life, and where he wrote most of his devotional works. Finally, in 1778, he was appointed chief pastor of St. Peter's Church at Hamburg. Here he at first lived happily, beloved and respected as a preacher and author, until, in 1782, his views on the Salvation of the Heathen led J. M. Goetze, chief pastor of St. Katherine's Church in Hamburg, to accuse him of nationalism. The resulting controversy embittered and shortened Sturm's life. In his latter years he suffered from a weak chest; and in the night of August 10, 1786, he was seized with an attack of spitting of blood, from which he never recovered. He died at Hamburg, on August 26, 1786."

On 16 July 1760 he purchased the principal part of the land now forming the Cambridge University Botanic Garden from Richard Whish, a vintner, and on 25 Aug. 1762 conveyed it to the university in trust for its present purpose. In 1763 he published anonymously A Short Account of the late Donation of a Botanic Garden to the University of Cambridge. He died at Cambridge, unmarried, on 15 December 1764."

Bayley was educated at the Whitchurch Grammar School, Shropshire, of which for a short time he acted as master. He became a methodist preacher, but afterwards took holy orders, and was the first incumbent of St. James's Church, Manchester, a ''proprietary church,`` which he built in 1787. The degree of B.D. was conferred on him at Cambridge in 1792, and that of D.D. in 1800. In 1782 he published his Hebrew grammar, entitled ''An Entrance into the Sacred Tongue. `` A second edition was issued after his death. He wrote notes and a preface to an edition of the ''Homilies`` of the church, published at Manchester in 1811. His other published writings were sermons and pamphlets, one being on the ''Swedenborgian Doctrine of the Trinity`` (1785). He died on 2 April 1812 at Manchester."

Serving as a Loyalist with the King's Orange Rangers during the American Revolution, he purchased a commission of major in the British Army. With his twin brother Henry (father of Abraham Pineo Gesner, a geologist and writer, best known as the inventor of kerosene), he came to Nova Scotia in 1779 and eventually settled on a farm at Belleisle in the township of Granville. Abraham became prominent in the province for fruit culture on the farm. In 1787 he married Elizabeth Steadman and they were the parents of twelve children. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1824 after Thomas Ritchie resigned, but did not run for re-election in 1827, citing his age and an interest in pursuing personal matters. Abraham died at Belleisle at the age of 94."

It appears unlikely that she was the mother of his actual successor Juqu Mujian. During Juqu Mujian's reign, a princess dowager was mentioned, without any names, and it could have been Princess Meng or Juqu Mujian's birth mother. If it was Princess Meng, then she died in the Northern Wei capital Pingcheng (, in modern Datong, Shanxi) after Juqu Mujian's capital Guzang (, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) had fallen to Northern Wei forces and he had been taken captive, but she was still buried with honors due a princess. The succession table below assumes that she survived to Juqu Mengxun's death in 433, but that is obviously conjecture. - style=``text-align: center;'' - - - style=``text-align: center;''"

His father was Walter Dudley Edwards, a journalist who came to Ireland with his wife, Bridget Teresa MacInerney from Clare, and became a civil servant. His mother was a supporter of women's rights and Dudley recalled that he had a 'Votes for Women' flag on his pram. Educated first at the Catholic University School, Robert moved to St. Enda's School after the 1916 rising, and then Synge Street CBS, finally returning to the Catholic University School. In his final exams he failed French and Irish but gained first place in Ireland in history.In 1933, Edwards married Sheila O'Sullivan, a folklorist and teacher. They had three children: Mary; Ruth Dudley Edwards, a historian, crime novelist, journalist and broadcaster, and Owen Dudley Edwards, a historian at the University of Edinburgh. Sheila died in April 1985. Robert Dudley Edwards died in 1988 in St. Vincent's Hospital after a short illness."

        "snippet": "He saw further active service in 1714 Malta, under Charles XII of Sweden in the north, and under the duke of Berwick in the short Spanish War of 1719. Charles XII he regarded as the first captain of all time, and it was at Stockholm that Folard began to formulate his tactical ideas in a commertary on Polybius. On his way back to France he was shipwrecked and lost all his papers, but he set to work at once to write his essays afresh, and in 1724 appeared his Nouvelles D'dcouvertes sur la guerre dans une dissertation de Polybe, followed (1727--1730) by Histoire de Polybe traduite par ... de Thuillier avec un commentaire de M. de Folard, Chevalier de l'Ordre de St Louis. Folard spent the remainder of his life in answering the criticisms provoked by the novelty of his theories. He died friendless and in obscurity at Avignon in 1752. An analysis of Folard's military writings brings to light not a connected theory of war as a whole, but a great number of independent ideas, sometimes valuable and suggestive, but far more often extravagant. The central point of his tactics was his proposed column formation for infantry. Struck by the apparent weakness of the thin line of battle of the time, and arguing from the cuneus of ancient warfare, he desired to substitute the shock of a deep mass of troops for former methods of attack, and further considered that in defence a solid column gave an unshakable stability to the line of battle. Controversy at once centred itself upon the column. While some famous commanders such as Marshal Saxe and Guido Starhemberg approved it and put it in practice, the weight of military opinion throughout Europe was opposed to it, and eventually history justified this opposition. Among the most discriminating of his critics was Frederick the Great, who is said to have invited Folard to Berlin. The Prussian king certainly caused a prcis to be made by Colonel von Seers, and wrote a preface thereto expressing his views. The work (like others by Frederick) fell into unauthorized hands, and, on its publication (Paris, 1760) under the title Esprit du Chev. Folard, created a great impression."

He then served aboard several Canadian fisheries patrol vessels. In 1909, Beard joined the Royal Naval Reserve and, in 1910, the Royal Canadian Navy. He served as senior naval officer at Esquimalt and as Commanding Officer and as Commander of the Dockyard at Naden. In October 1915, he married Kathleen Kent. He served as commander of Maritime Forces Pacific in 1922. At the start of World War II, Beard came out of retirement to command HMCS Prince Robert, which captured the German merchant freighter Weser off the coast of Mexico. He later retired due to poor health. His son Mishipman Thomas Norman Kemp Beard was killed on the HMS Hood during its encounter with the Bismarck in May 1941. Beard was a member of the Liberal-Conservative coalition in the provincial assembly. He died in office at Esquimalt and was buried with full military honours."

She spent the next year photographing California artists and their paintings, sculptures and murals. These images then toured to a variety of public institutions. Though she continued to photograph as an artist, Noskowiak's livelihood from the 1940s on was based on portraiture, fashion and architectural images. Noskowiak retired from photography in 1965, and she died in 1975 in Greenbrae, California."

In 1931, he moved to the newly formed Courtauld Institute of Art at the University of London, having been recruited as its first Director by Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham. In 1935, he succeeded Roger Fry as Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cambridge, while continuing as Director of the Courtauld. In 1937, he resigned both positions and in 1938 left England to become Curator of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He remained in the United States until his death in 1976."

He then moved to Vilnius in 1904, where he began to publish his first book and a collection of stories. These poems were extremely successful, and many editions were published. In 1907, Shneur moved to Paris to study Natural Sciences, Philosophy, and Literature, at the Sorbonne. He traveled throughout Europe from 1908 to 1913, and even visited North Africa. At the start of World War I Zalman Shneur was in Berlin. During the years of the war, he worked in a hospital and studied at the University of Berlin. Shneur returned to Paris in 1923. He stayed there until 1940, when Hitler's troopers invaded France. Shneur then fled to Spain, and from there he went to New York in 1941. He finally emigrated to Israel in 1951. He died in 1959 in New York."

From the late 1960s he became the centre of an ethnographic history school called the 'Melbourne Group'. He taught Sociology and History at La Trobe University, Melbourne and one semester of Anthropology at the University of Hawai'i before being appointed Max Crawford Professor of History at the University of Melbourne in 1971. As Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Melbourne, he was one of Australia's most eminent historians, and one of the preeminent historians and anthropologists of the South Pacific. From 1998 to 2004 he taught ten day graduate workshops at the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research at the Australian National University, Canberra. He died on 13 March 2008 in Hobart. Vanessa Smith, University of Sydney, described ``...his unique gift as a historian, unobtrusively demonstrating that the most acute critical perception is not incommensurate with the deepest appreciation of his subjects`` human circumstances.``"

However, out of concern for her husband's safety after the German invasion of Budapest, Romola took her husband to Sopron where they stayed until the end of the war. In 1946, Romola published an abridged version of Nijinsky's Diaries. Nijinsky died on April 8, 1950 in London, England. In 1952 Romola published her second biography of Nijinsky called The Last Years of Nijinsky. Romola died in Paris on September 9, 1978."

After his surgery, he lost a substantial amount of weight that he never regained with chemotherapy. After a lengthy recovery, it was discovered three years later in 2002 that he had a small tumor in his lung, which was taken out without trouble. In December 2003, he was again diagnosed with lung cancer, though they could not operate with the amount of scar tissue from the previous operation. Undergoing an experimental drug program in San Antonio, in April he started to decline, and moved in with family friends in Stephenville, TX, where he later died on June 9, 2004."

Patterson took over the operation of the Quebec branch when Osborne returned to England. In 1811, he acquired property at the Montmorency Falls where he established a large sawmill operation. Patterson also operated facilities on the Becancour River and the Etchemin River and also acquired cutting rights on large tracts of land in the Bois-Francs region, the Eastern Townships and along the Ottawa River. He purchased the seigneury of Beauport in 1844. In 1846, he helped found the Quebec and Lake Superior Mining Association and served as its first president. Patterson was also president of the Quebec and Richmond Railroad Company. He died at his estate at Montmorency at the age of 83."

Newspapers suggested that she had died during an abortion carried out by Restell, although later evidence seems to contradict this. Regardless, abortion was soon outlawed. Soon it became legally defined as an obscene subject and was no longer covered in the papers. Following Restell's arrest in early 1878, a maid discovered Restell in the bathtub at her Fifth Avenue home; she had slit her own throat on the morning of April 1, 1878. Upon her death, she was claimed to have been worth between $500,000-$600,000 ($-$ in present-day terms)."

In 1916, he entered school in Beijing, where he studied and conducted research concerning China's economic history. His graduation thesis was a 50,000 character study of the history of China's currency system. Believing in the ideal of industry as China's savior, he travelled to the University of California in 1924 to research economics. During this time, he closely read Anti-Duhring, The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, The Communist Manifesto, and other famous Marxist works. He returned to China in 1926. Jian was a patriot, and participated in the protests leading up to the March 18 Massacre of that year. He published his first Marxist interpretation of Chinese history during the 1930s, and joined the Communist Party of China in 1937. In 1934, while serving as secretary to Tan Zhen, deputy head of the Judicial Yuan, Jian went on a tour of numerous countries around the world. As a close ally of the Party, Jian became professor of history at Peking University after the party's rise to power in 1949, and later served as dean of the faculty of history and vice-president of the university."

His death received attention from the international media. President Mary McAleese said she was saddened by the death of ``such a young and talented public servant''. Thousands of people queued to sign books of condolence nationwide, with the figure soon reaching 10,000 while thousands of others clicked a tribute page on Facebook.

In 1889, she helped to found the Women's Literary Society, which later grew into the Womanhood Suffrage League in 1891. Speaking at committee meetings gave her confidence, and she eventually became a witty and accomplished public speaker. Her mother died in 1896, and Scott was left with a home and sufficient income for her needs. Her interest in votes for women led to much study of the position of women in the community, and she found that young girls were working in shops from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on ordinary days, and until 11 p.m. on Saturdays. Some of these girls were asked to come to her house on Sundays and describe the conditions in which they worked, and there leading politicians such as Bernhard Ringrose Wise, William Holman, W. M. Hughes and Thomas Bavin met and discussed the drafting of the bill that eventually became the early closing act of 1899."

        "snippet": "Wills played himself in the film version of the book All the President's Men, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's account of their reporting work on the Watergate scandal, but never recovered from his moments of fame. After his part in history, he quit his job as a security guard because he did not receive a raise for his role in discovering the burglary. In 1973, the topical song magazine Broadside published the song ``The Ballad of Frank Wills'', written by Ron Turner. Mr. Turner later recorded the song for Broadside/Folkways album, Broadside Seven. Wills worked for the comedian/activist Dick Gregory, lived in the Bahamas, and had a Harry Nilsson album dedicated to him. He made some money on the talk show circuit, but was unable to hold down a steady job. He returned home to South Carolina in the mid 1970s and cared for his stroke victim mother for several years. He was convicted of shoplifting in 1983. After her death in 1993, he was so destitute that he was washing his clothes in a bucket until James Kilby founded an organization, Treat Every American Right (TEAR) to raise money for Wills. Frank Wills died nearly penniless from a brain tumor on September 27, 2000, at University Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, having lived in poverty most of his life. Spike Lee loosely incorporated Frank Wills' story into Lee's 2004 film, She Hate Me. In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, Wills is the guard who takes Forrest's call complaining about men with flashlights across the street disturbing his sleep while he is staying at the Watergate Hotel across the complex from the DNC office."

In 1872 he became rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and vicar general of the diocese. He was named rector of St. Peter's Church in Troy in 1880."

Her father was a wealthy Cheshire salt dealer, who studied natural history and had famous greenhouses admired by Thomas Pennant (1726-1798). Inspired by her father, she devoted herself to study natural history in a more systematic way. To improve her understanding of the system developed by Carl von Linne (1707-1778), she learned Latin. She corresponded with Linne and Johann Reinhold Forster (1729-1798), who encouraged her to publish her entomological observations and devote herself to the museum of Oxford Hall. She enriched the collections by insect additions in particular thanks to specimens sent to her by Peter Simon Pallas (1741-1811). Her brother Ashton, who had gone to live in the United States of America, sent her many specimens, in particular birds, which were described by Pennant. She sent Linne specimens of birds and insects which were not described in his Systema Naturae. She died in Warrington. Johan Christian Fabricius (1745-1808), the pupil of Linne, dedicated the beetle Geotrupes blackburnii in 1781 to her. Dendroica fusca the Blackburnian Warbler, described by Philipp Ludwig Statius Muller (1725-1776) is also named in her honour."

Patrick Rafferty, the pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in the Fairmount neighborhood. His friendship with Rafferty eventually led Gilmour to convert to Catholicism in 1844, and he soon resolved to enter the priesthood. In 1846 he entered Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. In addition to his studies, he was named prefect of collegians and professor of mathematics in 1847. After receiving his Master of Arts degree (1848) and completing his theological studies, Gilmour was ordained a priest by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell on August 30, 1852."

Friends, however, again came to his assistance, and he was established in a coffee-house in Gracechurch Street; but this, like most of his business enterprises, ended in failure. Hone's attitude of mind had gradually changed to that of extreme devoutness, and during the latter years of his life, he became a follower of Rev Thomas Binney and preached in Binney's Weigh House Chapel, Eastcheap. In 1830 he edited Strutt's Sports and Pastimes of the people of England, and he contributed to the first number of the Penny Magazine. He was also for some years sub-editor of The Patriot. He died at Tottenham and is buried at Dr Watts' Walk in Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington."

Wraxall believed that the Government of the day, furious at his truthfulness, was behind a libel action which sent him to prison for three months in 1816. Hence the posthumous publication of the later memoirs. He died suddenly at Dover on 7 November 1831, whilst travelling to Naples."

He married twice, and had several children. What appear to be a son and grandson are recorded exhibiting paintings in London. Ebenezer Stanley Burchett (1837--1916) worked at South Kensington and then was Head Master of the Bedford Park School of Arts & Crafts. In 1870 Richard Burchett is described as ``formerly of 43 Brompton Square near the School, but now of 8 Bedford Road, Clapham.'' Burchett was in very bad health for the last years of his life, and when he died in Dublin, on May 27, 1875, he was staying with his wife's uncle, Sir Samuel Ferguson, for his health. He had only been in the School for 133 days in 1872, arriving punctually on only seven of these."

He soon assumed the editorship, which he held until his death in Nutley, New Jersey. He developed Puck from a new struggling periodical into a powerful social and political organ. In 1886 he published a novel, The Midge, followed in 1887 by The Story of a New York House. But his best efforts in fiction were his short stories and sketches Short Sixes (1891), More Short Sixes (1894), Made in France (1893), Zadoc Pine and Other Stories (1891), Love in Old Cloathes and Other Stories (1896), and Jersey Street and Jersey Lane (1896). His verses Airs from A ready and Elsewhere (884), containing the well-known poem, The Way to Arcady; Rowen (1892); and Poems (1896), edited by his friend Brander Matthews, displaying a light play of imagination and a delicate workmanship. He also wrote clever vers de societe and parodies. One of his several plays (usually written in collaboration), was The Tower of Babel (1883)."

As well as his own plays he made several translations and adaptations from his native German. He worked as Theatre Critic for The Sunday Telegraph between 1968 and 1978.

        "snippet": "He was born at Chalk, near Gravesend, in 1771. He was educated at the King's School, Canterbury, was apprenticed to an apothecary at Rochester, and completed his medical education at Guy's and St. Thomas's Hospitals. After qualifying at the College of Surgeons and Apothecaries' Hall, he entered on general practice in London. He became deeply interested in the legal status of the medical profession, and organised the Association of Surgeon-Apothecaries of England and Wales, with the object of improving the education and status of the profession. As chairman of this body Burrows was most indefatigable, and had a large share in the movement which led to the passing of the Apothecaries' Act in 1815. The society voted him five hundred guineas on its dissolution. On the formation of the first court of examiners of the Apothecaries' Company, on the passing of the act, Burrows was appointed an examiner; but early in 1817 he resigned, owing to the unfair conduct of the court of assistants. On this question Burrows published a Statement of Circumstances connected with the Apothecaries' Act and its Administration in 1817. At this time he was largely engaged in medical literature, being one of the founders and editors of the London Medical Repository, which commenced in January 1814, and the author of Observations on the Comparative Mortality of London and Paris in 1815."

In 1785 he went to Rome, and there became intimate with Angelica Kauffmann, with whom he painted several pictures. He also copied for the Empress Catharine seven of the best pictures in the galleries of Rome. He died at Florence in 1798. His best work is the 'Fainting of Queen Esther,' in the church of Alzano Maggiore, near Bergamo."

He studied the relationship between symbolism, invention, and memory in his early works, underscoring the applicability of the directed waking dream method in exploring sublimation. In the 1940s, Desoille referenced Jung's collective unconscious and presented his own conception of the mind based on Freud's three instances. The transference identified by Freud, Desoille believed, could be expressed and resolved in the directed waking dream. Finally in the 1950s and 1960s, concomitant to his political affiliations, Desoille held to a Pavlovian conception of neurosis, based on reflexes, in what was termed a ``rational psychotherapy''. Those reflexes that are poorly adapted could be dissolved through the directed waking dream method, according to Desoille, and, starting in the imagination, new dynamic stereotypes could be formed. Desoille died at age 76 in Paris."

He studied physics at Charles University in Prague, and then mathematics at Masaryk University in Brno under the supervision of Otakar Boruvka; he was awarded a doctorate in 1928. He then taught mathematics at the high school level until 1937, when he obtained a faculty position at Charles University. When the German army invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938, Wolf obtained an invitation to visit the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Sweden; he remained in Sweden as part of the underground resistance to the Germans until 1941 before emigrating to the United States. He taught at Macalester College for a year, and then joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley in 1942. At Berkeley, he was one of the co-founders of the Pacific Journal of Mathematics in 1951. He retired in 1972, but then moved to Guatemala where he helped to set up a graduate program in mathematics at the University of Valle. He died on August 12, 1989 in Berkeley."

The poet Helen Marion Burnside came to live with her in about 1875, and Carey's sister returned to keep house for them after her husband died. Carey died of lung cancer at her home in Putney, London on 19 July 1909."

From 1935 to 1945, she taught English and Dramatics at Norwalk High School in Connecticut. She married John William Harmon in 1946. Her first novel, Gateway, was published in 1946. Walden told her editor that she intended the novel for young people who lived at the gateway, on that middle ground between adolescence and adulthood. Walden claimed, ``I respond to young people because I remember my own adolescence so vividly -- and fondly. It was a period of total involvement, of enjoying life to the hilt.'' Walden wrote over 40 young adult novels. She died in 2002 in Westport, Connecticut. A collection of some of her literary manuscripts and correspondence with McGraw-Hill between 1954 and 1977 relating to book production is available for review in the Special Collections and University Archives of the University of Oregon Libraries."

And so impressive were Morris' parties at both her Beverly Hills home and her Los Angeles showroom that Town & Country magazine wrote ``Certainly this was THE top party of the holiday season,'' referring to a 1966 soiree at Morris' 17-room manse. Many Hollywood film fans would have relished being at the Morris showroom in 1970 when Joan Crawford stopped in to look for artwork for her home. Morris offered the screen legend a Coca-Cola. The following day, 20 cases of Pepsi-Cola arrived at the Phyllis Morris showroom with a note from Crawford saying ``Pour all those Cokes down the drain.''"

Soon after, the Hogues moved to Denton, Texas, and later attended the Dallas-based Bryan Street High School in 1918. After a short year at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, Hogue moved home to Dallas, where he was employed at the Dallas Morning News as an illustrator. In 1921, Hogue moved to New York City to work at various advertising firms with calligraphy assignments and to study in museums. He traveled back to Texas every summer while in New York to sketch with Charles Franklin Reaugh until he decided to plant himself in Texas in 1925 to paint. In 1931, he began teaching art classes at the Texas State College for Women and went on to become the head of the art department at Hockaday Junior College in 1936. In 1938, Hogue married and started a family with Maggie Joe Watson. During World War II, Hogue worked at North American Aviation. From 1945 to 1963, he became the head of the art department at the University of Tulsa. After his retirement from the University of Tulsa, the institution founded the Alexandre Hogue Gallery in his honor. Hogue remained in Tulsa until his death on July 22, 1994."

In 1797 he married Diana Ganning, daughter of a wealthy Norfolk lawyer, and the pair had four children, three of which survived, a baby boy dying in infancy. However, despite Lathom's burgeoning literary career and his growing family, some unknown cause led him to leave Norwich in 1810 and end his literary career. Summers has speculated this is related to Lathom's homosexuality, but there is no evidence one way or the other. He did separate from his wife shortly after this however and was given two thousand pounds a year in his father's will on condition that he break all ties with his children. His wife was awarded sole guardianship over the children in 1815 and the children were later renamed with their mother's maiden name. Lathom appears to have travelled extensively, visiting New York and Philadelphia and attempting to publish two novels in 1820. He also travelled in France and Italy, eventually settling in rural Scotland with a the Rennie family, where he died in Aberdeenshire in 1832. He was buried under the name of 'Mr James Francis' in a plot in Fyvie churchyard belonging to the Rennie family."

        "snippet": "Ibrahim Coulibaly (24 February 1964 -- 27 April 2011) was a military and rebel leader in Cote d'Ivoire. A Staff Sargent in the Armed Forces of Cote d'Ivoire, Coulibaly had served since at least the early 1990s. As Cote d'Ivoire slid into communal conflict, Coulibaly joined the 1999 coup led by Robert Guei. A second coup, following 2000 elections that made Laurent Gbagbo President, saw Coulibaly in a leadership position, after which he came into conflict with fellow military leader Guillaume Soro. During the ensuing eight years of division in the country, Coulibaly came into conflict with both sides, eventually returning to lead an Abidjan based militia supportive of Alassane Ouattara. Following the end of fighting, Coulibaly was killed in Abidjan by Ouattara's forces during an attempt to disarm his group. Known popularly as ``IB'', he was 47 years old at the time of his death."

MacLeod studied at McGill University. After moving to San Francisco, he continued his artistic training at the California School of Design under Frank Van Sloun. In 1921, MacLeod arrived in Hawaii, where he worked in the art departments of the magazine Paradise of the Pacific and the local papers, The Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. By 1929, he had returned to Canada and resided there for ten years. Again in Hawaii, MacLeod became the director of the graphic art department for the United States Army in the Pacific. In 1943, he published a book of his Hawaiian prints, The Spirit of Hawaii, Before and After Pearl Harbor. MacLeod retired to Palo Alto, California, where he died in 1956."

Impressed by her singing, he arranged her debut at The Town Hall in New York City on 9 December 1939. She received the Town Hall Endowment Series Award for 1940 as a result of this performance. In New York, she was taught by voice instructors William Clamroth and John Alan Haughton. Despite the fact that racism precluded her from performing in opera houses, Maynor toured extensively throughout the USA, Europe, and Latin America, performing in concert halls and frequently on the radio. In 1964, she founded the Harlem School of the Arts which was designed to give music education at a reduced rate to the children of Harlem. Under Maynor's directorship the school grew from 20 students to 1,000 by the time of her retirement in 1979. She received honorary degrees from several universities including Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, and two degrees from Howard University. In 1975, she became the first African-American on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera. She died on 19 February 1996 in West Chester, Pennsylvania."

His will bequeathed almost all of his considerable wealth into philanthropic trusts for housing of the poor, although during his life he had held no public office and did no charity work. His will was disputed by his family and by existing large landlords, among them the London County Council, who were worried that these cheap and desirable dwellings would lead to lower rents. Nonetheless, his will was proved and The Sutton Model Dwellings Trust (now known as the William Sutton Trust) built estates for the poor across England, beginning in Bethnal Green, then Chelsea, Islington, Rotherhithe, Plymouth and Birmingham."

When it was decided that the USFL was going to go head in the fall with the NFL, Bassett announced that he was pulling the Tampa Bay Bandits from the USFl, and suspending team operations. Bassett had co-owned the team with Stephen Arky, and actor Burt Reynolds. An USFL-NFL lawsuit was in progress at the time."

Part of the evidence used to secure his canonisation was the supposed resurrection of William Cragh, a Welsh rebel who was hanged in 1290, eight years after Cantilupe's death. A papal inquiry was convened in London on 20 April 1307 to determine whether or not Cantilupe had died excommunicate; if he had, then he could not be canonised. Forty-four witnesses were called and various letters produced, before the commissioners of the inquiry concluded that Cantilupe had been absolved in Rome before his death."

Kann recovered only a small fraction of his large collection before his death in England in 1948. Although he did not live to see a copy, the Nazi inventory of Kann's art collection ran to 60 typed pages. Decades after the war, several paintings from Kann's collection were discovered in prominent European and U.S. museums. ``Smoke Over Rooftops,'' a 1911 painting by Fernand Leger, was returned in October 2008 to Kann's heirs by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts after an eleven-year investigation."

According to one scenario he was murdered and the killers, probably members of the communist Secret Services, arranged the death to look like an accident. The official scenario, however, states that his death occurred after he fell from the stairs while being drunk. In 2011 his body was examined, and the outcome states that it was the fall that caused his death and that he had not been beaten."

Shepstone remained in Pretoria as administrator of the Transvaal until January 1879; his rule was marked, according to Sir Bartle Frere, who described him as ``a singular type of an Africander Talleyrand,'' by an ``apparent absence of all effort to devise or substitute a better system'' than that which had characterized the previous regime. Shepstone had been summoned home to advise the Colonial Office on South African affairs and he reached England in May 1879; on his return to Natal he retired (1880) from the public service. In 1883, however, he was commissioned to replace Cetshwayo as king in Zululand. He was active in church matters in Natal, and was, prior to the Langalibalele ``rebellion'', a close friend of Bishop Colenso. The two men, though, became estranged following Colenso's gradual realisation that Shepstone exerted a malign influence on Zulu affairs. Shepstone opposed the grant of self-government to Natal. He died at Pietermaritzburg on the 23rd of June 1893."

Jacobetti died in office on November 28, 1994 at his home in Negaunee. His burial location is the Northland Chapel Gardens in Negaunee Township. It was through his long tenure as the head of the Appropriations Committee, though, that Jacobetti had the largest impact. Jacobetti's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee wielded significant influence over direction of revenue in the state of Michigan and this made Jacobetti a powerful politician. Though the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is relatively low in population in comparison to the rest of the state, Jacobetti used his position to help direct sometimes significant funding to the Upper Peninsula (considering its low population), including the building of the Superior Dome, among other projects. It was his position and influence that was pointed to when an effort to pass a term limits amendment to the state constitution was initiated, an effort which was successful. In the last few years of his tenure on the committee, there was a scandal involving misappropriation of funds by the committee. Jacobetti was initially stripped of his chairmanship and a number of Fiscal Agency employees were investigated and imprisoned. Jacobetti was re-elected to his final term of office in 1994 and cleared of any wrongdoing in the House Fiscal Agency scandal by Michigan Attorney General Frank J. Kelley."

He married in 1853 Emily Grace, daughter of C. B. Newenham of South Australia. He was knighted in 1857. Cooper's Creek, (now Cooper Creek), in central Australia was named after him by his friend, Captain Sturt. Cooper was a thoroughly capable judge who earned the esteem of the colonists. He held courts at first in his own house, which had the advantage that he was constantly on the premises. He was a sound lawyer and framed the first insolvency legislation of the colony. Though not robust looking, he was hospitable and interested in the social and intellectual life of the colony."

In 1819, he moved to Savannah, Georgia, where he involved himself with the Baptist ministry. He introduced and widened the support of the temperance movement after moving to Georgia. While in Georgia, his manual-labor system helped inspire the founding of Mercer University and in 1857, he became president of Marshall College in Griffin, Georgia. Between 1827 and 1860, he collected statistical information on Georgia's counties and place names, which he compiled into his publication A Gazetteer of the State of Georgia. Sherwood published as many as five different editions between the years of 1827 and 1860. After his farm in Butts County, Georgia was burned by Sherman's troops at the end of the Civil War, Thomas Adiel Sherwood moved to Missouri, where he died on August 19, 1879. He was married to Emma Heriot, his second wife after his first wife and daughter died, in 1824 and they had five children."

They rented the mansion of Zulestein, where they dwelt until the invasion by the French republicans in 1795. After a time at Colchester they settled at Bath, Somerset. Cogan rented a farm at South Wraxall, near Bradford-on-Avon and studied agriculture; when he left Bath he took farms at Clapton and at Woodford, and at the time of his death he was the tenant of a farm near Southampton. Mrs. Cogan died at Bath in 1810 and was buried at Widcombe; her niece, Miss Gurnault, died soon after. Cogan gmoved to London. The last years of his life were mainly passed in his lodgings in London or at his brother's house at Higham Hill. He died there on 2 February 1818. On 9 February he was buried at Hackney."

        "snippet": "Ed Townsend was married once and had two sons and one daughter, Kathryn Griffin-Townsend (one son was David Townsend, former guitarist for Surface). He died on August 13, 2003 in San Bernardino, California at the age of 74 and enjoyed the company and professionalism of Janice Carbonnaire his last passion. He loved children and honored the families of EBT New LIFE as often as he could celebrating their milestones fully entertaining the large brood of 'adoptees' to his condo/home in Reseda. Around 2002, he began using a wheel chair after he fell a couple times getting to the mic. Although he was able to fully rehabilitate from drugs and alcohol and spent his sober life helping others up from a life of abuse, he never was able to knock his smoking habit and preferred clove tobacco which likely weakened his heart. However, nothing could have weakened his heart more than to see a world ignore his call for a world sobriety check. More love for humanity you could not find, it was shameful that he remained an addict so long. His articulate speech and immaculate writing skills created an unbelievable individual that fostered the careers of so many. With unmarried son David's sudden passing two years later at the youthful age of 50, the sole heir to Ed's works is his sister, Helen. Although Ed Townsend moved away from his roots, he never left them behind. Exacting yet unpretentious, Edward B. Townsend, set a standard for so many other young hopefuls to model. May his memory live on and may we face the denial on a world self-medicating when our families needed us. A world too busy self-medicating and feeling sad and glum than one to pick up the lives of those youths around them and beyond. He wanted everyone to work together, he understood all, he had been there and done that already. Honored with a purple heart in the Korean War, he was given a full military gun salute at his memorial at Riverside National Cemetery."

        "snippet": "In 1839 Anderson was joined by a second missionary, Reverend Robert Johnston, who proved a most valuable coadjutor. In the course of a few years the number of Scotch missionaries was increased to four. In 1843, on the disruption of the church of Scotland, Anderson and his colleagues joined the Free Church, and thenceforward the mission was carried on in connection with that church. The subject of female education soon attracted Anderson's attention. There was no diffi- culty in securing the attendance of girls of the lower castes; but in the case of native caste girls the difficulty was, and still is, very great. Indian girls marry early, and native parents see none of the material benefits to be derived from their education, which induce them to send their sons to mission schools, even at the risk of their being led to change their religion. But these obstacles were gradually overcome in some measure, and before Anderson's death seven hundred Hindu and Mohammedan girls, the majority of the former belonging to families of good caste, were under instruction in the schools of the mission. In this branch of his work Anderson was greatly helped by Mrs. Anderson. Anderson died at Madras in March 1855, after a short illness. He had laboured indefatigably for eighteen years at the work for which he had been set apart; only once during that period revisiting his native land, whither he was accompanied by the Rev. P. Rajahgopal, one of his first converts. His constitution, naturally strong, had become enfeebled by his incessant toils and anxieties in a debilitating climate."

During the last days of the Third Reich, he was responsible for the machine room in the Fuhrerbunker and he stayed in the bunker after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex and was released on 4 April 1949. Hentschel died in 1982 in Achern, West Germany. Oliver Stritzel was cast as Hentschel in Downfall (Der Untergang). However, in the theatrical release most of his scenes were cut and he only briefly appears restoring power to a failing generator, as well as in the epilogue which explains what happened to all the characters. In the extended version of the film, his performance is included. In his scenes, Hentschel tells Otto Gunsche that he is staying in order to maintain the generators. Later, he goes to the surface and looks at the burnt remains of Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels. Returning to the bunker, he finds a group of female Soviet soldiers who ask where Hitler and Braun are, then ask to be taken to Eva's wardrobe. He asks them not to open the door to the Goebbels' room, which they do anyway and find the bodies of the Goebbels children."

Siddons had an eye for talent, bringing on Daniel Terry and William Oxberry. Joanna Baillie's Family Legend was produced by Siddons on 29 January 1810. On 15 January 1811 Siddons produced the Lady of the Lake; an adaptation in which he himself played Fitzjames. But he was fighting an uphill battle, and lost much money. He died at Edinburgh on 12 April 1815."

After his father's death, Roberday was appointed King's goldsmith, and in 1659 he bought the job of the official manservant to the Queen. Unfortunately, Roberday's business gradually declined and by the time of his death he was quite poor. He died in 1680 in Auffargis, a village south of Paris, during an epidemic."

He was first destined for the missions of Heartier, whence he was ordered (1577) to Juli, on the shores of Lake Titicaca in Southern Peru. He became one of the founders of this important mission. Barcena remained in Central Bolivia for eleven years, when the Provincial Juan de Atienza sent him to Tucuman in Argentina. His work among the various tribes of that region and of Paraguay continued until 1593, when he was made Commissary of the Inquisition in those provinces. Exhausted physically by his long and arduous labors, Barcena died at Cuzco in Peru."

In 1902 he served in South Africa as a lieutenant in the 4th Battalion; he was a councillor at Port Fairy from 1906 to 1915, serving as mayor from 1912 to 1913. In 1914 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for Port Fairy (he would switch seats to Warrnambool in 1927). In July 1924 he was appointed Minister of Lands and Water Supply, serving until November and again from May 1927 to November 1928 and from December 1929 to May 1932. In 1932 he was expelled from the Labor Party for supporting the Premiers' Plan to fight the Depression, and he was defeated in the election later that year. After contesting a by-election for his old seat in 1933 as an Independent candidate, he joined the Country Party in 1934 and was re-elected to the Legislative Assembly for Warrnambool in 1935, being immediately appointed minister without portfolio. He was given the Labour portfolio in June 1936 and was promoted to Attorney-General in April 1938, serving until September 1943. He held his seat until 1950, when he was defeated. Bailey died at St Kilda."

        "snippet": "Legge was born at Cullenswood, Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land). He was educated mainly in Britain, also in France and Germany, and became a proficient linguist. He was also educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1862 he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, serving first in Bath, England, and then in Melbourne for several years. From Melbourne his battery was transferred to Colombo, Ceylon, where he was stationed 1869-1877. He then took a staff appointment at Aberystwith, Cardiganshire, for five years. Subsequently he moved back to Tasmania and served for eleven years as Commandant of the Tasmanian Defence Forces, retiring as Lieutenant-Colonel when he reached the age-limit. He trained Tasmanian forces for the Second Boer War. He died at Cullenswood on 25 March 1918 at the age of 76, survived by his wife and two sons from his first marriage."

With his health beginning to fail, with Cuba expelled from the OAS, and with a need to attend to his own economic affairs, he decided that he ``would better serve the revolution from abroad.'' After a brief stop in Mexico he returned to Argentina, to Bahia Blanca, and to his status as a voice in the wilderness. He completed his three books on Marti (none of which were published in his lifetime and one of which remains unpublished ), wrote a work on Balzac, and continued to write poems (notably his Tres poemas del anochecer -- Three Poems at Dusk -- the last work he published in Sur). He spoke of returning to Cuba; it is not entirely clear whether his failure to do so was entirely a matter of his health or related to traces of disillusionment with the revolution that are evidenced in his correspondence. He died November 4, 1964 in Bahia Blanca."

In May 1940 he fled to the Netherlands by swimming across the Rhine River. Unfortunately he arrived just as the German Wehrmacht invaded the neutral country.

All the arrangements had been made and the pictures hung when war broke out. Young had been a good marksman in his youth, and for three years worked as an instructor in musketry and machine-gunnery. Immediately after the war he took up his painting again and exhibited at the Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists. Back in Australia in 1923 Young established himself at Montrose in the hills about 20 miles east of Melbourne. He acted as art critic for The Herald and held occasional one-man shows. His position was now secure, and he was recognized everywhere as one of the leading artists in water-colour in Australia. He died at Montrose and was survived by his wife and two daughters."

Ross graduated from Whitefish High School with a 4.0 GPA and was valedictorian of his class. After completing his Bachelor's Degree at the University of Chicago, Ross studied at Georgetown University, then at Indiana University under Charles S. Hyneman, who took Ross on a 15,000 mile, 5-year trip across America to give Ross first-hand experience of the country. In 1970, Ross researched at The British Museum. He began teaching at the University of Houston in 1971, where he also served as Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Political Science for 23 years. Throughout his career, Professor Lence was a perennial participant, leader, and director at Liberty Fund Colloquia. He died on July 11, 2006 in Houston, TX."

The company was able to salvage one of the railroad project and it became a lucrative business, being one of the first rail lines in the state. He was able to speed up production, and more track was laid in his first two years as president than had been in the previous ten years of public management. In 1850 he bought one of the four bookstores in Indianapolis and started a book publishing firm. Over the years this firm became known as Merrill, Meigs, and Company, followed by the Bowen-Merrill Company, and finally the Bobbs-Merrill Company. In 1849 he married Elizabeth Young following the death of his first wife. Samuel Merrill died in 1855 in Indianapolis, at the age of 62 overseeing the merger of his publishing and book store businesses."

After four years at St. Mark's, he became abbot of a monastery at Veglia (now Krk, Croatia), on an island off the coast of Dalmatia, a position which still required his part-time involvement at St. Mark's. He resigned from St. Mark's in 1619, and his position was taken by Alessandro Grandi. Negri died at Veglia."

It was approved by both houses in October 1882, and Madero was entrusted not only with overseeing the completion of Sir John Hawkshaw's design of adjoining impounded docks; but also with negotiating the necessary financing of the project. The first dock was opened in 1889 and, as work continued northward, the second one was opened in 1890. The Panic of 1890, however, led to the suspension of works, a setback remedied by a congressional appropriation in 1892. The resulting political controversy helped result in Madero's relocation to Genoa, Italy, where he died in 1894 at the age of 71."

In 1889 another volume of verse, In the Garden of Dreams, confirmed her reputation as a poet. She also wrote several volumes of prose fiction, including Miss Eyre from Boston and Other Stories, and some descriptions of travel, including Lazy Tours in Spain (1896). She was well known for the extent of her literary influence, the result of a sympathetic personality combined with fine critical taste. She died in Boston on the 10th of August 1908."

He lectured freely in America and made yearly visits to the Free University of Berlin. Here, he acted as an adviser for the faculty. He kept the psychologists in touch with American psychology by collaborating with them in research and enthusiastically engaging in discussions with them. He was honoured to receive the Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award of the American Psychological Association in 1956.

The Talmud published with the imprint of Von Schmid and Bush was prized for some time afterwards for its exactness. For six years (1842--47) Bush edited and published the Kalender und Jahrbuch fur Israeliten (Vienna). Its plan was the presentation in the same book of the productions of leading Jewish scholars of divergent views. Among these were Leopold Zunz, S. L. Rapoport, S. D. Luzzatto, Gotthold Salomon, Ludwig Philippson, Michael Sachs, Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Joseph Wertheimer, Leopold Stern, Theodor Creizenach, Ludwig August von Frankl, Leopold Kompert, Leopold Low, and Simon Szanto. Some of these made their first appearance as writers in the pages of the ``Jahrbucher.'' In 1844 he edited Mesillat ha-Limmud (Way of Instruction), which was published by his father after Bush had left for America. Liberal in politics, he edited the Osterreichisches Zentral-Organ fur Glaubensfreiheit, and other revolutionary papers issued from his press."

From 1903 he worked as an orchestral cellist and violist and appeared as a soloist in Copenhagen, Paris and Stockholm. His greatest success as a composer and conductor was with the opera Leonora Christina which premiered at Det Kongelige Teater in 1926. The opera was successful due to its use of popular style and the performance of the soprano Tenna Frederiksen Kraft in the title role. His output includes two other operas, Duen og slangen (Doves and Serpents; 1925) and Dronning Dagmar (Queen Dagmar; 1928). Among his other works is a lovely Violin Concerto in g, opus 26 from 1916. He died in his native city of Copenhagen."

In his youth he entered Gethsame Skete in Sarov and became a call attendant to Archimandrite Anthony. In 1860 he took his vows and began a life of asceticism at Gethsame.

In January 1953, Li became a member of the committee assigned to draft the first constitution of the People's Republic. He served as a delegate to the National People's Congress in 1954. The new constitution reduced the number of vice-chairmen from six to two, so Li gave up his post and became a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Li continued to hold posts in the government until his death on 9 October 1959 in Beijing due to stomach cancer and a cerebral thrombosis."

        "snippet": "Briggs was born at Norwich, for which city his father, Augustine Briggs, was four times M.P. At thirteen he was entered at Corpus Christi, Cambridge, under Thomas Tenison, became a fellow of his college in 1668, and M.A. in 1670. After some years spent in tuition and in studying medicine, he went to France and attended the lectures of Raymond Vieussens at Montpellier, under the patronage of Ralph Montagu (afterwards Duke of Montagu), then British ambassador to France. To him Briggs dedicated his Ophthalmographia, an anatomical description of the eye, published at Cambridge in 1676, on his return from France. He proceeded M.D. at Cambridge in 1677, and was elected a fellow of the London College of Physicians in 1682. In the latter year the first part of his Theory of Vision was published by Robert Hooke (Philosophical Collections, No. 6, p. 167); the second part was published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1683. The Theory of Vision was translated into Latin, and published in 1685 by desire of Sir Isaac Newton, who wrote a commendatory preface to it, acknowledging the benefit he had derived from Briggs's anatomical skill and knowledge. A second edition of the Ophthalmographia was published in 1687. Several points in Briggs's account of the eye are noteworthy, one being his recognition of the retina as an expansion in which the fibres of the optic nerve are spread out ; another, his laying emphasis upon the hypothesis of vibrations as an explanation of the phenomena of nervous action. Briggs practised with great success in London, especially in diseases of the eye ; was physician to St. Thomas's Hospital 1682-9, physician in ordinary to William III of England from 1696, and censor of the College of Physicians in 1685, 1686, 1692. In 1689, according to a curious memorial on one sheet preserved in the British Museum, Dr. Briggs was at great expense in vindicating the title of the crown to St. Thomas's Hospital, but was himself dismissed from his post, owing, as he states, to the machinations of a rival physician. From the same sheet we learn that, although he attended the royal household with great zeal for five years, he could get no pay ; and notwithstanding that in 1698 William III promised that he should be considered, this was of no avail. In consequence of these circumstances, apparently early in Anne's reign, he begs for consideration in regard to the hospital appointment. He died 4 Sept. 1704, at Town Malling in Kent. His son, Henry Briggs, chaplain to George II, and rector of Holt, Norfolk, erected a cenotaph to his father's memory in Holt church in 1737. The inscription is quoted by Munk. His portrait, by R. White, was engraved by Faber."

These appointments he retained until his death, and their duties were discharged by him with success; for although he loved a joke, even in court, he never allowed this propensity to get the mastery over his natural astuteness. His face was naturally droll, his wit was caustic, and he was ''capital at the dinner table. `` He died at Sloane Street, Chelsea, on 10 Jan. 1850, aged 76. He married at Bloomsbury Church in August 1815 Harriet Cresswell, daughter of Richard Cheslyn Cresswell, registrar of the Arches Court of Canterbury. By her, who survived him, he had three sons, and one daughter. One of his last acts was to raise a subscription for the family of the late R. B. Peake, the dramatist."

        "snippet": "He left Bletchley in November 1767, and on Lady day in the following year he very honourably resigned the rectory in favour of Browne Willis's grandson, the Rev. Thomas Willis, merely because he knew it was his patron's intention so to bestow the living if he had lived to effect an exchange. Cole now went into a hired house at Waterbeach, five miles from Cambridge. This house, little better than a cottage, was very uncomfortable. To make matters worse, he discovered that he had got into a parish which abounded with fanatics of almost all denominations. Writing about this period to his friend Father Charles Bonaventure Bedingfeld, a Minorite friar, he says: ``My finances are miserably reduced by quitting the living of Bletchley, and by half my own estate being under water by the breaking of the Bedford river bank at Over after the great snow in February was twelvemonth;'' and he proceeds to remark: ``Yet I am not disposed to engage myself in any ecclesiastical matters again, except greater should be offered than I am in expectation of. I have already refused two livings, one in Glamorganshire, the other in Oxfordshire; for I have no inclination to the duty and do not love to be confined.'' He still had a hankering after a semi-monastic life, for he wrote to Bedingfeld on 20 April 1768: ``Could I have my books and conveniences about me, I should nowhere like better than to finish my days among my countrymen in a conventual manner,'' though not, he takes care to explain, as a monk or friar, because he had no religious vocation. A second overflow of the Hundred Foot river at Over still further diminished the value of his estate, and on 18 February 1769 he wrote to the Rev. John Allen: ``I hardly ever now really enjoy myself for three days together, as the continued wet weather alarms me constantly; so that I am come to a resolution to sell my estate and purchase elsewhere, or buy an annuity.'' At Michaelmas 1769 he had his first attack of gout, which complaint afterwards caused him severe and frequent suffering. About May 1770 he removed from Waterbeach to a small house at Milton,near Cambridge. Here he spent the remainder of his days, and was familiarly distinguished as ``Cole of Milton,'' though he was sometimes spoken of jocularly as ``Cardinal Cole.'' In May 1771, by Lord Montfort's favour, he was put into the commission of the peace for the borough of Cambridge. In the following year Bishop Keene, without any solicitation, sent him an offer of the vicarage of Madingley, but he civilly declined it. He was, however, on 10 June 1774 instituted by Dr. John Green, bishop of Lincoln, on the presentation of Eton College, to the vicarage of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, vacant by the cession of his uterine brother, Stephen Apthorp, D.D. He still continued to reside at Milton, where he died on 16 December 1782, his constitution having been shattered by repeated attacks of gout. He lies buried in St. Clement's Church, Cambridge, under the steeple, which bears on its front his motto, Deum Cole. On the right hand of the entrance to the church is a monument, with an inscription stating that the steeple was erected with money left by him for the purpose,"

        "snippet": "Amon Bazira (1944--1993) was a Pan-Africanist leader and organiser who created an extensive intelligence network that was a clandestine component of the struggle to end the regime of Ugandan military dictator and president, Idi Amin. After helping to remove Idi Amin, Bazira served as Deputy Director of intelligence, and then as Director of Intelligence in Uganda in 1979. He produced a government report predicting that there would be a massive genocide in Rwanda that would lead to the collapse of order in Central and Eastern Africa, and proposed granting citizenship to Rwandan refugees and other displaced Africans in Uganda, as a means of preventing genocidal warfare. In August 1993, Amon Bazira was assassinated in Kenya at Nakuru, allegedly with the complicity of Tiny Rowland, Yoweri Museveni and Daniel arap Moi. Bazira's Pan African ideas and efforts helped in the creation of the African Unification Front, which has advanced the cause of Pan Africanism."

The delicate health of some members of his family then rendered a change of climate imperative, and he paid a prolonged visit to continental Europe. On his return MacCarthy settled in London, where he published - in addition to his translations - Shelley's Early Life, which contains an account of that poet's visit to Dublin in 1812. MacCarthy had already resettled in his native land of Ireland for some months, when he died on Good Friday, 1882 at Blackrock, Dublin. His poetical gifts were inherited by his daughter, who became a nun, and wrote as Sister Mary Stanislaus."

On his return in October he brought Isaac Casaubon to England in his suite. In June 1612 he was nominated commissioner of the treasury on Salisbury's death. In November 1616 he was made treasurer of the household, but on 23 Dec. 1617 he was ``persuaded'' to retire from that office by the payment of five thousand pounds. This did not satisfy him, and he clung to office some weeks longer in the vain hope of extracting a viscountancy as a further compensation. He was excluded from the council on Charles I's accession on the ground of being a catholic. He retired to Boughton Malherbe, where he died early in 1626; the inquisitio post mortem was taken on 12 April."

He was first declared elected to the provincial assembly after appealing two consecutive elections. Howe also served as justice of the peace and judge in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas for Annapolis County. He was named captain in the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment and also was superintendent of Jamaican maroons. After he was replaced in that post, he moved to Prince Edward Island in 1802 where he served as assistant commissary and storekeeper. Howe also served on the colony's Council and was a justice of the peace there. In 1803, he married Margaret Ann Green, the granddaughter of Benjamin Green. After two of his sons died accidentally and he suffered financial losses, Howe returned to Nova Scotia where he died in Dartmouth at the age of 63."

Belevitch's heavily pregnant mother succeeded in crossing the border into Finland and continued on to Helsinki after Vitold was born, where the birth was registered. She headed for Helsinki because her husband's father was principal of the Russian school there.

In his efforts, he even enlisted a cousin, Robert Campbell from Scotland to assist on the farm with such endeavours as trying to raise sheep from Kentucky. Later, he was transferred to the Montreal area out of frustration with the farm's failure and his dislike of Red River Colony society. In 1839, McMillan retired to Scotland where he lived with his Scottish wife, Eleanor McKinley, with whom he had eight children. He also fathered at least four North American children stemming from relations with native women from the Columbia Region, Saskatchewan and Fort George. One of whom, William McMillan, was a co-signatory to the Metis petition for special status, 1845. In his final years, McMillan contributed to Simpson's Narrative of a journey round the world, during the years 1841 and 1842, and kept apprised of events in the fur trade through Simpson and others. He died in 1858 in Perth, Scotland."

The firm was temporarily embarrassed at the beginning of the American Civil War, on account of its large business interests in the South. The reputation of Claflin increased because of his promptness in paying off debts during the financial panic of 1873. He died at Fordham, New York, on the 14th of November 1885."

Here he entered the Royal Academy of Music, 5 December 1845, to study under Sterndale Bennett, and became organist at Earl Howe's Curzon Street church. On his return to Bolton Fawcett resumed his duties as organist, teacher, and (1849) honorary conductor of the Bolton Harmonic Society. He obtained the degree of Mus. Bac., Oxford, 3 November 1852. His exercise, a sacred cantata, ''Supplication and Thanksgiving,`` was performed at the Music School, the composer conducting, and was published by subscription in 1856. This well-written cantata is the most important of Fawcett's compositions. He died at Manchester 1 July 1857."

        "snippet": "He was the son of Adolph Lindberg, another famous sculptor. Following his father he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Stockholm in 1893 and obtained a scholarship. This enabled him to spend some years in Paris, from around 1901 to 1902 where he was influenced by modern French medal engravers of that period such as Roty, Chaplain, Tasset and Vernon. In 1901 Lindberg was given the task of creating the Nobel medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine and Literature. The Peace medal was created by Norwegian Gustav Vigeland. According to correspondence between Lindberg and his father, the designs were not quite ready for the first ceremony in 1901; the reverse sides of the medals required approval from the Prize-Giving association, and so the winners were given temporary medals. In November 1901, after lengthy discussions by letter, Lindberg returned to Stockholm to present his ideas in person. However, it wasn't until September the following year the designs were ready and the first winners received their proper prize. In 1915 he received a gold medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exhibition. Many of his works are in the collection of Stockholm Museum."

After serving in the armed forces in World War I, he immigrated to Canada in 1927, coming directly to the South Nahanni River via the Mackenzie River and Fort Simpson. It was there that he encountered the young Raymond M. Patterson who brought him attention in his book ``The Dangerous River'' and attracted 3 documentaries. Though these focused on his search for gold, Faille was known as a friendly knowledgeable guide of the South Nahanii region. Mr. Faille died on new years day in 1974 at his home in Fort Simpson."

Stark's work most clearly showed the influence of Impressionism, and he often featured children in his work. He began his career as a commercial woodcarver's apprentice in Indianapolis until an ankle injury disabled him. In 1875, he went to Cincinnati where he worked as a lithographer and attended the Cincinnati Art Academy. He studied with William Merritt Chase at the Art Students League of New York. In 1885, he entered Academie Julian in Paris. He studied in Paris until 1888, and he exhibited paintings in the Paris Salons of 1886 and 1887. He also married while living in France. Stark and his family returned to the United States in 1888, living first in New York and later in Philadelphia."

He had in early life been associated with the evangelicals, but became a moderate high churchman. He did not take a leading part in ecclesiastical affairs, but was an excellent chairman of the English committee on faith and order. He was lecturer in pastoral theology at Cambridge University in 1899 and Ramsden preacher in 1901. He had a serious illness at the end of 1917 and resigned his see in August 1919.

Rudler studied in Paris at the Lycee Louis-le-Grand and the Ecole Normale Superieure and, after graduating, taught rhetoric at various lycees including Louis-le-Grand. For his doctoral thesis of 1908, for which he was directed by the scholar Gustave Lanson, he studied the French-born writer and academic Benjamin Constant, and the result was regarded as a major contribution to scholarship relating to Constant. After a period teaching at the Sorbonne, Rudler moved to Bedford College (now part of Royal Holloway, University of London) in 1913 as professor of French. Apart from military service during the First World War, he spent the remainder of his academic life in England. In 1920, he was appointed as the first Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford, and was also made a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He was regarded as a devoted teacher, lecturing in French and asking questions of his audience that had to be answered in French. Retiring in 1949, he returned to Paris, where he died on 17 October 1957."

He then became a school teacher in September 1882 and occasionally contributed verse to The Bulletin. He retired from the education department in 1887 after being found drunk by a school inspector. In 1894 he went to the recently discovered goldfields in Western Australia, prospected in various parts of the west, and at variously made and lost a considerable sums of money. About the turn of the 20th century Bourke took up journalism and was a regular contributor to the Kalgoorlie Sun. He was a writer of vigorous prose and verse which gave him a local reputation, but he was comparatively little known away from the gold-mining towns. He visited the eastern states of Australia for medical advice and to seek a publisher for his books in 1913. Bourke died at Boulder, Western Australia, on 13 January 1914. A selection from his verse, Off the Bluebush, edited by A. G. Stephens, was published in Sydney in 1915."

        "snippet": "Lionel Belasco (1881 -- c. June 24, 1967) was a prominent pianist, composer and bandleader, best known for his calypso recordings. According to various sources, he was born either in Barbados or in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; he grew up in Trinidad, the son of an mother and a Sephardic Jewish father. He travelled widely in the Caribbean and South America in his youth, absorbing a wide variety of musical influences. He was leading his own band by 1902. He made his first phonograph recordings in Trinidad in 1914, and soon after first traveled to New York City, where he made more recordings and set up a publishing business. He would continue to travel back and forth between New York and Trinidad for the rest of his life. He is unusual as a calypsonian in the fact that his instrument was the piano, (not exactly the best instrument for the calypso tent.) It is because of this that his style is more orchestrated and arranged. Instead of marching the streets or playing the tents, as was the custom for the average calypsonian, he instead became a darling of the local elites, playing the high class balls and debutante dances. In fact, around this time (1903-4) he began giving piano tutorials to the mayor's daughter. Don Hill, an expert on the subject, who wrote detailed liner notes on the ``Goodnight Ladies and Gents, the creole music of Lionel Belasco'' CD, claims that ``According to rumour'', he taught her a bit more than simply how to play the piano.... she was shipped back to England in disgrace, and Belasco was forced to flee to New York, where he died."

He became Professor of Political Economy and Vice-Chancellor of the Queen's University of Belfast in 1934. He became BBC's second director-general from 1938 to 1942. He made little impact at the BBC, although an exception was recruiting Lindley M. Fraser to head the BBC's German service.

Although it is impossible to say for certain what his ultimate stance might have been, his connections ran at the highest levels of both Canada and the fledgling United States. His brother Alexander had moved to New York City after the Revolution, where he quickly became a prominent land speculator. Alexander's house in New York briefly served as the second Executive Mansion for George Washington, before the Federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790. Alexander's son and namesake would enter the United States Army upon the recommendation of no less than Alexander Hamilton and later fight in the War of 1812; he would be decorated for his command of American troops at the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814, and in later years would be appointed Commanding General of the U.S. Army. The younger Alexander would marry his cousin Catherine in 1803; their descendants would serve the United States in both military and naval roles."

Although he had never visited the island, he proved popular with the its political leaders of all parties and with the Puerto Rican residents of his neighborhood. He also resumed the practice of law. On July 2, 1947, Mayor William O'Dwyer appointed him city magistrate of New York City to fill a vacancy; later that month he was appointed to a full ten-year term. As the result of a one-day shortage of magistrates in March 1948, Lanzetta attracted notice by presiding in five courts in five hours and disposing of 500 cases, 400 of which were in Downtown Traffic Court. He served as city magistrate until May 26, 1948, when Mayor Wagner appointed him to a ten-year term as a justice of the Domestic Relations Court of New York City. He served in this capacity until his death in New York City on the night of October 27, 1956 while visiting at the Greystone Hotel on Broadway. He was survived by his widow, Ethel, three brothers, Patsy, Dr. Louis, and John, and two sisters, Angelina and Regina. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York."

The recovery from illness of Edmund Kean arrested his career. On 24 September 1818, at Drury Lane, then under Stephen Kemble, he played Jaffier in Venice Preserved, Subsequently he appeared as Lord Townly in the Provoked Husband, and Pyrrhus in Orestes, He was the original Titus in Howard Payne's Brutus, or the Fall of Tarquin, 3 December 1818, and Angelo in Buck's Italians, or the Fatal Accusation, 3 April 1819. He failed to establish any strong position, and discovered at the close of the second season that his presence was necessary on the Suffolk circuit. On 7 November 1823 he appeared at Bath in 'Hamlet', and subsequently as Shylock, Leon, and Jaffier. He was pronounced a sound actor, but with no claim to genius, and failed to please. Returning again to the eastern counties, he built theatres at Bungay, Beccles, Halesworth, Eye, Lowestoft, Dereham, North Walsham, and other places. About 1838 he retired to Woodbridge, where he died 20 August 1858. He was a musician and a scene-painter, and in the former capacity was leader for some time of the Norwich choral concerts."

From 1811 until his death he was a member of the Berlin Academy, and professor at the same from 1814 onwards. He died at Potsdam in 1850. One of his most famous pictures is 'The Descent from the Cross,' the altar-piece at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. In the Berlin Gallery is a 'State Entry,' painted by him."

He designed many groups, of nymphs and amorini and medallion subjects to form the centre of Pergolesi's bands of ornament, and they were continually reproduced upon the elegant satin-wood furniture which was growing popular in his later days and by the end of the 18th century became a rage. Sometimes these designs were inlaid in marqueterie, but most frequently they were painted upon the satin-wood by other hands with delightful effect, since in the whole range of English furniture there is nothing more enchanting than really good finished satin-wood pieces. There can be little doubt that some of the beautiful furniture designed by the Adams was actually painted by Cipriani himself. He also occasionally designed handles for drawers and doors. Cipriani died at Hammersmith and was buried at Chelsea, where Bartolozzi erected a monument to his memory. He had married an English lady, by whom he had two sons."

After becoming a monk he practised only calligraphy, developing a simple and unadorned, yet unique style, which was treasured by everyone who received a sample. He became known to all as Master Hong Yi. In 1942, Master Hong Yi died peacefully at the age of 63 in Quanzhou, Fujian Province."

        "snippet": "James Davidson, more affectionately known as Jim, was born at Aspatria on 28 December 1868. He received his education at the Aspatria Agricultural College, where he excelled at sport, winning representative honours at both Association Football and Rugby Union. For over fifteen years Davidson was a prominent member of Aspatria RUFC, playing as a forward in the old scrimmaging style. He played for Aspatria when they won the Cumberland County Rugby Union Cup in 1891, ``92, ``96 and ``99. He won forty-four Cumberland County caps; made a record number of eight appearances for the North in their annual games against the South; played several times for the Rest of England in their annual game against the County Champions, and although selected to represent England on seven occasions, would, through ill-health and injury, play in only five. In 1897, he played for England in the game against Scotland; in 1898, against Scotland and Wales; and in 1899 against Scotland and Ireland. In the Calcutta Cup match in 1898, he was, according to one journalist, the ''man of the match``. ``When the whistle blew no man came off the field on either side fresher or more ready to renew hostilities than James Davidson.'' Upon retirement from the game Jim became a respected official. He was chairman of the County Selectors Committee, and the Cumberland representative to the Rugby Union. He was also one of the principal administrators in the Aspatria Club and held numerous offices. He was a stonemason and builder by trade, a man with a giant frame, noted for his great strength, sporting attitude and determination. Described in the sporting journal, Sporting Life, as ''Hard as Nails``. In 1898 he became the first recipient of a sporting testimonial in Cumberland. He died at Aspatria on 23 December 1943."

He died of AIDS-related complications on October 3, 1988 at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, and was buried in a paupers' grave. In November 1988, Massachusetts organized crime figure James J. Bulger, who had befriended Carnes while on Alcatraz, paid for his body to be exhumed and reburied on land in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Bulger reportedly bought a lavish $4,000 bronze casket and paid for a car to transport Carnes' remains from Missouri to Oklahoma."

On several occasions -- notably in connection with the redemption of the Italian railways, and with the Paris Exhibition of 1878 -- he acted as representative of the government. In 1877 he was given the lucrative appointment of Secretary of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by Depretis, and in 1886 was created senator. He died at Rome, leaving a considerable body of writings on a variety of subjects, none of which is of exceptional merit."

        "snippet": "Franz Caucig, an Austrian historical painter, was born at Gorz in 1762. He studied the first principles of art at Vienna, and went, aided by a grant, in 1781, to Bologna and to Rome, where he spent seven years. In 1791, he was enabled in the same way to visit Mantua, and to reside for upwards of five years at Venice. He returned to Vienna in 1797, and in 1799 became professor of historical painting at the Vienna Academy, and, in 1820, Director of the School of Art, which office he held until his death. Specimens of his paintings, which were numerous, may be seen at Prague, and in the Belvedere and other galleries at Vienna. He was clever as a draughtsman, and has left us upwards of 2000 historical designs. His colouring, however, was feeble and indifferent. He died at Vienna in 1828."

He developed a taste for literature, and his miscellaneous works include The Savages of Europe (London, 1764), a satire on the English which he translated from the French, and Anecdotes Ancient and Modern (London, 1789), an amusing collection of gossip. His chief work was a History of Great Britain connected with the Chronology of Europe from Caesar's Invasion to Accession of Edward VI, in 2 volumes (London, 1794--1795). Its plan is somewhat singular, as a portion of the history of England is given on one page, and a general sketch of the contemporaneous history of Europe on the opposite page. He also wrote a History of Great Britain from Death of Henry VIII to Accession of James VI of Scotland -- a continuation of Robert Henry's History of Great Britain, which left off at the death of Henry VIII -- published in 1796 and again in 1806. Andrews died at Brompton and was buried in Hampstead Church. He married Anne, daughter of Thomas Penrose, rector of Newbury."

Between 1890 to 1894, the composer embarked on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. Beginning in 1904, he served as editor for several musical periodicals, including Monthly Hymnal, Minister of Music, and Music and the Higher Life. He also compiled several hymnbooks; Mission Hymns in 1911 and Festival Hymns in 1916. He died on 8 August 1922 in London."

He was elected in March 1640 to the Short Parliament, as member for Oxford University, and he entered the Long Parliament in October as member for Corfe Castle. In December the House learnt that he had signed letters of grace to recusant priests and Jesuits, and summoned him to answer the charge, but the king allowed him to escape to France. From Calais, he wrote to Christopher Hatton, defending his integrity, and affirming his belief that the Church of England was the purest and nearest the primitive Church. He remained in Paris until his death, shortly after he had been received into the Roman communion."

When he heard about maltreatment of Polish forced labourers (e.g. of a pregnant woman), he brought that courageously into public and spoke about it during church announcements. That caused reaction of Nazi authorities. He was arrested. On 28th of July, 1941 he was transferred from Potsdam prison to a concentration camp. In the period of eleven months he was in three concentration camps: Buchenwald, Ravensbruck and, finally, Dachau, where he died because of bad prison conditions on 22nd of June, 1942."

David's account was corroborated by Michele Nicoli, a former associate of David's who is currently in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's witness protection program. Sarti was the only man David explicitly named, as Sarti had been killed by police in Mexico City in 1972. The trio had all been working for heroin trafficker Auguste Ricord, a known client of the Marseilles underworld, at the time of Kennedy's death. Writer Stephen Revelle, the man who named Sarti on ``The Men Who Killed Kennedy'', said that Sarti was the one who had fired from the grassy knoll and hit the president in the head. Journalistic and police sources in Paris and Marseille told Revelle that Sarti was known as an extremely daring and reckless man, known and despised even by his own associates for taking enormous chances; but that the willingness to take these chances was what made him such a successful drug trafficker and assassin."

His father drowned when Beti was seven, and he was raised by his mother and extended family. Beti recalls arguing with his mother about religion and colonialism; he also recalls early exposure to the opinions and analysis of independence leader Ruben Um Nyobe, both in the villages and at Nyobe's private residence. He carried these views into the classroom, and was eventually expelled from the missionary school in Mbalmayo for his outspokenness. In 1945 he entered the lycee Leclerc in Yaounde. Graduating in 1951, he came to France to continue his higher education in literature, first at Aix-en-Provence, then at the Sorbonne in Paris."

He studied initially at Jesus College, Oxford, commencing in 1624 aged 22, before moving to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with a BA from Dublin before returning to Oxford to obtain his MA in 1632. His movements thereafter are uncertain for a few years, although his son Constantine was born in 1639 or 1640. In 1643, he was appointed to the parish of Fyfield, Essex. In 1644, he argued for the biblical validity of presbyterian church government, with his views being published as The angel of the Church of Ephesus no bishop of Ephesus, distinguished in order from, and superior in power to a presbyter, dedicated to William Twisse. In August 1647, he moved from Fyfield to Bristol to take up a position as vicar of St Nicholas. In 1650, he was alleged to have preached against the council of state and, whilst protesting, did not deny all the charges. He was allowed to remain a minister on condition that he did not return to Bristol, although temporary permission was given on two occasions in 1652 and the prohibition was removed in April 1654, after Jessop had become rector of Wimborne Minster in Dorset. Also in 1654, Jessop wrote a preface to John Grayle's A Modest Vindication, entitled The nature of the covenant of grace, wherein is a discovery of the judgment of Dr. Twisse in the point of justification, clearing him from antinomianism therein. On 16 April 1658, Jessop died at Wimborne; he was buried there. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and his son, Constantine, who became rector of Brington, Northamptonshire and a prebendary of Durham Cathedral."

At last his adherence to the royalist party compelled him to quit his post, and he removed to New York, where he died, 25 May 1780, aged 50. His wife seems long to have survived him. Benjamin Smith Barton, the American physician and naturalist, was one of his children."

In 1912 he sailed to China on a freighter, the Indrade, with a light opera singer, Mrs Francis Hewitt Bowne: he was listed as purser and she was disguised as a cabin boy. The couple married in 1928 after their respective partners had divorced them. His published works include Jules of the Great Heart: ``free'' trapper and outlaw in the Hudson Bay region in the early days (1905), To the Credit of the Sea (1907), The White Darkness, and other stories of the Great North-West (1907), and Prairie, Snow and Sea (1910). He pioneered fishing for steelhead on the North Umpqua River, Oregon, and a bridge and a section of the North Umpqua Trail bear the name Mott in his memory. He established a fishing camp near Steamboat Creek, where he died, of leukemia, in 1931."

Bill Apter, a writer and journalist who specializes in wrestling, wrote of Maivia following her death: When my daughter Hailey, who is now 23, met Lia at a wrestling event in upper New York state, Lia went to a gift shop at a nearby hotel and bought Hailey a stuffed bunny as a gift. She had never met her before this day, and this shows what a heart she had!"

It became a runaway best-seller and won the Pulitzer Prize. Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country (1946) was another highly successful Perkins find. His last discovery was James Jones, who approached Perkins in 1945. Perkins persuaded Jones to abandon the novel he was working on at that time and launched him on what would become From Here to Eternity (1951). By this time, Perkins' health was failing and he did not live to see its success, nor that of Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea (1952), which was dedicated to his memory. Perkins died on June 17, 1947 in Stamford, Connecticut."

Due to her close connections to Mosley and Barry Domvile Special Branch regarded Allen with some suspicion, although they declined to detain her under Defence Regulation 18B as they saw her as a ``crank...trailing round in a ridiculous uniform''. Eventually however she was placed under a lesser form of detention, being restricted to within a five mile radius of her Cornwall home and banned from using cars, bicycles, telephones and the wireless."

In 1959 he was invited to the Mariinsky Theatre in Leningrad where he gained world fame as a leading soloist from 1959 to 1989.

At the same time, he started painting, and in 1903, aged fifteen, he entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, where he was taught by Franz Courtens, and where he won the 1913 de Keyer's Prize. During those years, he already made illustrations for a number of novels and for the magazine Lange Wapper."

In those he expressed a celebration of the natural beauty and folk culture of his native province Skane, southern Sweden. The raffined poetry did not fit the Swedish realism of the 1880s-90s and gained little attention. Hansson followed up with the decadent Sensitiva Amorosa (1887), a collection of morbid, erotic sketches that shocked the Sweden of his day. The reaction from the public was harsh, and Hansson left his country for Germany in 1889. He would then continue to live abroad for the remainder of his life, in countries such as Switzerland and Turkey (where he also died)."

After having been for some time incumbent of Fawley, near Wantage, in Berkshire, he was appointed on 21 March 1717 to a prebend of Canterbury, which he resigned on his appointment as canon of Christ Church, Oxford, on 24 May 1723. He received the degree of D.D. on 27 August of the same year; and on 29 August 1724 was nominated to both the deanery of Christ Church and the bishopric of Bristol, receiving the two preferments in commendam. He published in 1730 a Sermon preached before the House of Lords on 30 Jan. 1729-30. Bradshaw died at Bath on 16 December 1732, and was buried in Bristol Cathedral."

She was accompanied by the violinist Ernest Llewellyn and the pianist Raymond Lambert. She toured her native land for four months, and a further two months in New Zealand. During World War II she sang over 1,300 times in hospitals, air raid shelters, army camps and factories throughout Great Britain, and entertained Australian soldiers at her London home."

He married his first cousin, Mildred Foster Barham; became curate at St Sidwells, Exeter; then rector of Shirland, Derbyshire; he subsequently resided at Clifton, Bristol, and was for twenty-three years curate in charge of St Mary le Port Church, Bristol. He died at Clifton on 8 April 1870, and was buried in the cemetery at Weston-super-Mare. Though he published little, his compositions were numerous, especially his sermons. Studious and contemplative, he mingled little with society. He was an accomplished scholar and poet. As well as the works listed below, he wrote a large number of small poems and lectures, many of which were published in the Weston Mercury. There remain unpublished several manuscripts, especially a valuable series of theological lectures."

He sat in these bodies as a member of the Progressive party (Fortschrittspartei), and in Bavaria was one of the leaders of the Liberal (Freisinnige) party. His eloquence had a great hold upon the masses. As a parliamentarian he was very clear-headed, and thoroughly understood how to lead a party. For many years he was the reporter of the finance committee of the chamber. In 1882, on account of his great services in connection with the Bavarian National Exhibition of Nuremberg, the order of the crown of Bavaria was conferred upon him, carrying with it the honor of nobility. He died at Nuremberg on the 31st of December 1902."

John F. Slater was educated in academies at Plainfield, Connecticut, and Wrentham and Wilbraham, Massachusetts. At seventeen he entered his father's woollen mill in Hopeville, Conn., of which he took charge in 1836. This and other mills he owned in partnership with his brother, William S Slater, until 1873, when his brother took over the Slatersville Mills and he assumed sole ownership of the mills at Jewett City. In 1842 he removed from Jewett City to Norwich; there he helped to endow the Norwich Free Academy, to which his son presented the Slater Memorial Hall. Slater also endowed Park Congregational Church in Norwich and donated Slater Library. Slater died on the 7th of May 1884 and his funeral was held at Park Congregational Church, where he was an attendant."

Lee, the latter named for the King family friend, Robert E. Lee. Lee is said to have chosen the location for the King's home on the King ranch, as a location easy to defend. Following Robert Kings's early death at age 19, King is said to have taken to drink; however, other sources suggest that this was self-medication for a recurring stomach pain. He died of stomach cancer at the Menger Hotel in San Antonio on April 14, 1885, at age 60. He was buried in San Antonio; upon his wife's death in 1925, he was re-interred with her on the King Ranch, at Kingsville. King's ghost is said to haunt the Menger Hotel, particularly the suite named for him."

Weber spent the remainder of his life in the American Midwest, first returning to Sainte Genevieve and his former position as recorder with the mines. By 1833 Weber was assistant superintendent of government mines in Galena, Illinois, and served briefly as superintendent until his retirement in 1840. Weber moved to Bellevue, Iowa where he died in 1859."

Ashley was among the administrators of the estates and Cooper later accused these administrators of attempting to wrest some of his lands from him while he was still a minor and a Ward of Court. Ashley he singled out as the worst and most avaricious offender who used his legal abilities and influences to obtain his ends through the Ward of Courts. In one of these proceedings on 16 November 1635, Ashley was making a speech before the Court when his nephew uttered a prayer to be delivered from the lawyer's arguments and purposes. At this point Ashley collapsed with a paralytic seizure with ``his mouth drawn to his ear'' and was carried out of the Court and never spoke again. He died 12 days later on 28 November 1635 at the Serjeant's Inn in Fleet Street at the age of 66. His body was brought back to Dorchester and buried in St Peter's church."

Besides all his other skills, Michell was an accomplished water-colourist, particularly of landscapes. His illustrations appeared in Narrative of a voyage of observation among the colonies of Western Africa and of a campaign in Kaffirland (1837), written by his son-in-law, Capt.

But as the British Embassy was about to issue Visas for Egypt, Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis. In an ironic twist, this gave him the opening into film for which he is remembered. Films included: Un' Avventura di Salvator Rosa (The Adventure of Salvator Rosa) (1939); Sei bambine ed il Perseo (Perseus and the six children) (1940); Il Re d'Inghilterra non paga (The King of England Won't Pay) (1941); Don Buonaparte (1941); Don Cesare di Bazan (1942) aka La Lama del giustiziere, (The Executioner's Blade Italy: reissue title). The war came home to Italy in 1943 and the country was divided in bitter civil war. The film movement that emerged from the turmoil, characterised by Italian Neorealism, had little need of classical actors like Umberto Sclanizza, and, amidst persistent ill-health, he returned occasionally to theatre work before his death in Venice on 14 December 1951."

He was badly off in his later years, ''his children having drained him,`` and was assisted by private friends, including several heads of colleges. He was deeply versed in school divinity, and a better Latin than English poet. Wood calls him ''the common epitaph-maker for dissenters;`` Calamy says he wrote but three, for Thomas Goodwin, D.D., John Owen, D.D., and Ichabod Chauncey. When Calamy was at Oxford (1691--2), he found Gilbert regularly attending the ministry of John Hall (1633--1710), bishop of Bristol and master of Pembroke, for one of the Sunday services, and for the other that of Joshua Oldfield at the presbyterian meeting, an example followed by other Oxford dissenters. He was on intimate terms with Hall, Bathurst, master of Trinity, Aldrich, Wallis, and Jane. Calamy describes him as ''very purblind,`` as ''the completest schoolman`` he ever knew, in his element among ''crabbed writers,`` yet sometimes ''very facetious and pleasant in conversation. `` Calamy has preserved some of his stories, told after a supper of ''buttered onions. `` Gilbert died at Oxford on 15 July 1694, and was buried in the chancel of St. Aldate's."

Working out inter-service and inter-department conflicts was a serious goal for the U.S. Navy going into the Cold War. As of September 1945, the qualifications for a district commandant were those of a line officer eligible for command at sea, and the shipyard (specialist) commands were no longer to be held by the same officer. Deyo met the new qualification for District Commandant, and had served at Boston twice before as an instructor and aide to the Commandant during a time of reorganization. Inefficiency from command conflicts were taken under study even before the war ended by the ``Farber Committee''. The main feature of reform related to the various types of authority over district activities. The Commandant was to have coordinating ``military command'' over all activities in the district akin to Army districts. The Navy Secretary directed satisfactory relationships. With a background of local relationships, technical expertise, leadership and diplomatic skills, Morton Deyo was the man chosen to make it happen. He retired at the end of his tour with a promotion to Vice Admiral. Admiral Deyo died November 10, 1973 in Kittery Point, Maine."

He visited the United Kingdom in 1877 and had a cattle property near Campbelltown. In 1880 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Camden; he served until 1882 and then again from 1885 to 1887, 1889 to 1895, and 1898 to 1904. He was Secretary for Mines and Minister for Agriculture from 1901 to 1904, and during his various terms was associated with the Protectionist and Progressive parties. He had been a supporter of Federation from 1891. Kidd died at Campbelltown in 1919."

He also rebuilt most of the palace at Ely, and furnished a gallery of portraits of its bishops from the Reformation. Many of Keene's appointments to livings did him credit, and where there was no resident incumbent he reserved to himself the right of appointing to the curacies, but he did not escape hostile criticism, and the epigrams of Gray were especially severe. He died at Ely House, Dover Street, London, on 6 July 1781 and at his own desire was buried in West's Chapel, Ely Cathedral, with a short epitaph written by himself."

In November 1706 Sage was seized with paralysis while on a visit to Kinross. He recovered sufficiently to take part in a consecration at Dundee on 28 April 1709. He then went to Bath. Moving on to London, he remained there about a year. He died at Edinburgh on 7 June 1711; his intimate correspondent, Henry Dodwell the elder, died on the same day. Sage was buried in the churchyard of Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh. John Gillan in his Life of Sage gives a long Latin inscription intended for his tomb."

The Sedleys (also sometimes spelled Sidley) had been prominent in Kent since at least 1337. Sedley's grandfather, William Sedley, was knighted in 1605. He was the founder of the Sidleian Lectures of Natural Philosophy at Oxford. Sedley was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, but left without taking a degree. There his tutor was the poet Walter Pope. The second surviving son of Sir John Sedley and Elizabeth, William, succeeded to the baronetcy in 1645. Charles Sedley inherited the title (5th baronet) in 1656 when his brother William died. By his first wife Lady Katherine Savage, daughter of John, 2nd Earl Rivers he had only one legitimate child, Catherine, Countess of Dorchester, mistress of James II. The couple lived in Great Queen Street. After his first wife had been sent to a convent in Ghent on account of a serious mental condition, Sedley in vain tried to obtain a divorce. He met Ann Ayscough, probably around 1670, by whom he had two illegitimate sons, William and Charles Sedley. William died in infancy, the brother Charles was knighted by William III after the coronation in 1689. The relationship with Ann Ayscough lasted to the end of Sedley's life. Sedley died at Hampstead on 20 August 1701 and was buried at Southfleet Church on the 26th."

Nearly half a century after his death, Plutzik's work continues to earn the admiration of critics and scholars. British poets Ted Hughes and Thom Gunn included some of his poems in their 1963 anthology Five American Poets. Hughes wrote that ``Hyam Plutzik's poems have haunted me for twenty-five years'' with their ``point-blank, wholehearted simplicity of voice. ... The best of his work seems to me marvelously achieved, a sacred book.'' In his 2001 book Cold War Poetry: The Social Text in the Fifties Poem, Edward Brunner declared that ``Plutzik's achievement is stunning'' and that some of his poems ``go unmatched by any other postwar poetry except that of Langston Hughes or Gwendolyn Brooks.'' 6 Earlier, in his Foreword to the 1987 Collected Poems7, Anthony Hecht wrote that Plutzik's poems ``deserve to be far more widely known and admired than at present they are,'' calling him ``a poet of such remarkable achievement.''"

The ball passed through his chest and diaphragm, lodging in his abdomen. The ball was removed later that day, but despite medical treatment, Drummond died five days later, at Charlton, near Woolwich, and was buried in the vaults of St Luke's Church, Charlton on 31 January."

His body was carried back to Delhi, where he was buried on the ground of the shrine of Qadam Sharif.

Prior to Canadian Confederation in 1867, Wier represented Halifax township from 1851 to 1859 and Lunenburg County from 1859 to 1863 in the colonial Nova Scotia House of Assembly. During that period, he served in the province's Executive Council from 1855 to 1856 and from 1859 to 1863. After losing his seat in the Nova Scotia election of 1863, he turned his attention to his many business interests. He was president of the Dartmouth Marine Railway and of the Salt Works Company. Weir was also a director of the People's Bank, the Union Marine Insurance Company, the Sydney Marine Railway and the Nova Scotian Telegraph Company. He also served as an alderman for the city of Halifax. Following Confederation, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada on 23 October 1867 by royal proclamation. He represented the senatorial division of Nova Scotia until his death in Ottawa at the age of 62."

Born in Harlem, New York, he began as the touring pianist in the backing band for King Curtis and eventually worked with artists such as Bob Dylan, Steely Dan, Don McLean, The Isley Brothers, Van Morrison, The Shirelles, and Dionne Warwick. He may be best known for playing on the critically acclaimed albums Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde and Aja. His distinctive piano accompaniment to Don McLean's ``American Pie'' is considered by many to be a defining element of that mega-hit recording. In addition, he worked on several films. He was an arranger for The Warriors (1979) and Four Friends (1981) and performed in On Location: Robert Klein at Yale (1982) and on the soundtrack for Blue Sunshine (1976). Griffin died at age 62 at his home in New York."

Their wedding plans were broken off in 1924 when Bishop William Manning refused to authorise the marriage, citing Lydig being a divorcee with two living former husbands. Rev. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving his personal fortune to the woman he had hoped to marry, and Lydig spent large sums of money on fashion, art, furniture, and other objects to overcome her grief. Heavily in debt, she was forced to sell her Washington Square home and its contents, was declared bankrupt, and died of pernicious anaemia at the Gotham Hotel shortly after, at the age of 54."

        "snippet": "Flavel, the eldest son of the Rev. Richard Flavel, described as ''a painful and eminent minister,`` who was incumbent successively of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, Hasler and Willersey, Gloucestershire (from which last living he was ejected in 1662), was born in or about 1630 at Bromsgrove. Having received his early education at the schools of the neighbourhood, he entered University College, Oxford, at an early age, and gained a good reputation for talent and diligence. On 27 April 1650 he was sent by ''the standing committee of Devon`` to Diptford, a parish on the Avon, five miles from Totnes, where the minister, Mr. Walplate, had become infirm. On 17 Oct. 1650, after examination and the preaching of a ''trial sermon,`` he was ordained Mr. Walplate's assistant by the classis at Salisbury. He continued to minister at Diptford for about six years, succeeding the senior minister when he died, and endearing himself greatly to the people, not only by his earnestness, but by his easy dealings with them in the matter of tithes. In 1656 he removed to Dartmouth, though the Diptford emoluments were much greater. On the passing of the Act of Uniformity (1662) he was ejected, but continued to preach in private until the Five Mile Act drove him from Dartmouth. He kept as near it, however, as possible, removing to Slapton, five miles off, and there preached twice each Sunday to all who came, among whom were many of his old parishioners. On the granting of the indulgence of 1671 he returned to Dartmouth, and continued to officiate there even after the liberty to do so was withdrawn. In the end he found himself obliged to remove to London, travelling by sea and narrowly escaping shipwreck in a storm, which is said to have ceased in answer to his prayers. Finding that he would be safer at Dartmouth he returned there, and met with his people nightly in his own house, until in 1687, on the relaxation of the penal laws, they built a meeting-house for him. Just before his death he acted as moderator at a meeting of dissenting ministers held at Topsham. He died suddenly of paralysis at Exeter on 26 June 1691, and was buried in Dartmouth churchyard. Wood bitterly comments on the violence of his dissent. Flavel was four times married: first to Jane Randal; secondly, to Elizabeth Morries; thirdly, to Ann Downe; and, lastly, to a daughter of the Rev. George Jeffries. There is a portrait of him in Dr. Williams's library, London. He was a voluminous and popular author. There is a play of fine fancy in some of them, such as the ''Husbandry Spiritualised. `` All display vigorous diction and strong evangelical sentiments. They comprise: 1. ''Husbandry Spiritualised,`` Lond. 1669. 2. ''Navigation Spiritualised,`` Lond. 1671. 3. ''The Fountain of Life Opened, or a Display of Christ in his Essential and Mediatorial Glory, containing forty-two sermons,`` Lond. 1672. 4. ''A Saint indeed,`` Lond. 1671. 5. ''A Token for Mourners,`` Lond. 1674. 6. ''The Seaman's Companion,`` Lond. 1676. 7. ''Divine Conduct, or the Mystery of Providence Opened,`` Lond. 1678, 1814, 1822. 8.

Charles Bradley edited a selection in 1823."

        "snippet": "Bohumir Kryl (originally Bohumir Kryl, and sometimes spelled in the United States as Bohumil) was born in Horice, Bohemia, near Prague, on 2 May 1875. His first instrument was the violin, which he studied at age 10. While attending school in Horice he was classmates with Jan Kubelik, with whom he maintained correspondence. He spent time performing both the violin and the cornet for a circus band in Prague. He also performed as an aerialist acrobat with the Rentz Circus in Germany, but an accident in 1886 ended this line of work. His father was a sculptor, and Bohumir also studied this art. He emigrated to the United States in 1889, paying the fare in part by performing with the ship's orchestra. Moving to Chicago, English sculptor H.R. Saunders furthered his profession in that area. Bohumir followed Saunders to Indianapolis and was soon employed, along with his brother, as a sculptor by General Lew Wallace and also working on the Soldiers`` and Sailor's Monument. During this time he joined the When Clothing Company Band, playing the cornet and soloing on this instrument. Before long he was hired by John Philip Sousa, but left in 1898 to join Thomas Preston Brooke's Chicago Marine Band, where he spent the next two years. During this time he studied with Weldon of Chicago's Second Regiment Band. In 1901 he spent some time with Phinney's United States Band, but he joined the Duss Band permanently that year. This group was based at Madison Square Garden, at $800 per-month and became its assistant conductor in 1903. This band, led by Frederick Innes, was not as well known, but he was hired as soloist, and the heavy touring schedule and two solos per concert gained him wide exposure. His solos would result in requests for multiple encores. Studying bandleaders Creatore and Vessela, he adopted a wild 'lionesque' hairstyle that became his trademark. He became acquainted with Joseph Jiran, who owned a Czechoslovakian music store in Chicago. With Jiran's encouragement, he formed his own band in 1906 styled as Kryl's Bohemian Band by 1910 with the Cimera brothers. This group worked for Columbia, Victor, and Zonophone, recording works by such composers as Smetana, Dvorak, and Safranek. He earned the distinction of the first Czech musician to record on phonograph cylinders. World War I interrupted his professional career, as he was serving in the U.S. Military. Here he attained the rank of Lieutenant and was given the title ``Bandmaster of all the Military Camp Bands in the country``. Immediately after the war he was touring with his bands, including many appearances on the Chautauqua circuit. This activity continued until he dismantled the band in 1931. From 1926 to 1929 he would spend winters at his mansion in Tarpon Springs, Florida. He built a bandshell on his property and would give numerous concerts each year. Through his compositions and band touring, he became a millionaire by the mid 1920s. The Great Depression did not affect his personal affluence as much as others, as he was a bank president and a known financier in 1932. He later formed a ``Women's Symphony Orchestra'' that featured daughter Josephine on violin and daughter Marie on piano. He also formed and conducted the ''Kryl Symphony Orchestra``, which featured soloists such as Florian ZaBach and vocalist Mary McCormic. His public musical career ended in the late 1940s, when he had difficulties with the American Federation of Musicians, because although his musicians were well taken care of, he did not pay scale. His last groups played popular dance music as well as ''heavier classics``. Before his musical retirement, he had traveled more than one million miles and soloed more than 12,000 times. His touring included many small towns such as Albany, Oregon and Bend, Oregon, where his orchestra was the first appearance by any symphony orchestra there. Aside from the United States, he toured Canada, Cuba, and Mexico with his bands and orchestras and America and Europe with his daughters. He later formed booking agency and a music bureau. An Honorary Doctor of Letters was given to him in 1957. He died at his summer home in Wilmington, New York, on August 7, 1961, leaving an estate valued at over 1 million dollars. His widow was Mary Jerabek Kryl."

He was the first Canadian to make a parachute jump from an airplane in Canada, in 1919. Ellis wrote extensively on the history of aviation, and was an avid aircraft model builder. He located several historic Canadian aviation artifacts and arranged for their donation to museums. In 1954 he published ``Canada's Flying Heritage'', the first major study of the History of aviation in Canada. In 1972 he was awarded the Medal of Service of the Order of Canada.

He soon returned to the Pacific Northwest as an employee of the North West Company. He worked as a labourer at Fort Georgia (the name of Fort Astoria under the NWC). When the company was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1821, Naukane remained at Fort Georgia as an HBC employee. In 1823 he was sent with King Kamehameha II to England to visit King George IV. He spent most of the rest of his life near Fort Vancouver, working for the HBC. He had a wife in 1825 and appears to have had a Native slave, Marie, whom he likely inherited through a previous Native wife. He appears to have retired in 1843 or 1844 and probably continued to live in Kanaka Village at Fort Vancouver. He died on February 2, 1850, at Fort Vancouver."

In 1653 he was, with certain other justices, directed to prevent royalists landing or gathering in Cumberland or Lancashire, and at the end of that year he was, with Bradshaw, appointed a commissioner for reviving the duchy jurisdiction at Westminster. In 1654 he was appointed one of the commissioners for keeping the seal of the county of Lancaster. From a letter written to him by Thomas Aldam in 1654 it appears that his favour to quakers had made him very unpopular; but in 1655 he was directed to proceed to London to determine cases in the duchy court at Westminster. For several years before his death Fell withdrew from parliamentary life, disapproving of the Protector's assumption of authority in civil and religious matters; and although Cromwell is believed to have made several overtures to him, he still declined to take any active part in the government. He died at Swarthmore on 8 Oct. 1658, and was buried in Ulverston Church by torchlight. The record of his burial states that he was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster."

        "snippet": "Harold Collis Featherstone (13 May 1913 - 29 September 1990) was a prominent Baha'i from Adelaide, Australia. Born in Quorn, South Australia and a childhood in Smithfield, South Australia and then studied accounting but took up engineering in 1932 when he worked for a large engineering firm until 1936. By the time he married in 1938 he was already a partner in an engineering business making pressed metal parts. He and his wife joined the Baha'i Faith in 1944 as the first ``young people'' to enter in the Adelaide community (see Baha'i Faith in Australia and he exchanged some 20 letters and cables on all manner of subjects with the then head of the religion. In 1946 the Featherstones helped establish the Woodville Baha'i Local Spiritual Assembly. Featherstone served in the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia from 1949 to 1962. In 1954 he was appointed of a new institution for the religion as an Auxiliary Board member for Australia by Clara Dunn and was able to rearrange his business affairs to allow him flexibility and freedom to travel widely by becoming a co-owner of an engineering company. In October 1957 he was appointed a Hand of the Cause of God by Shoghi Effendi. From 1957 Featherstone maintained an 18-member Auxiliary Board (nine for propagation, nine for protection), spread throughout the Pacific, until that function was assumed by a three-member Continental Board of Counsellors for Australasia in 1968. In 1976 Featherstone sold his business interest and the family moved to Rockhampton, Queensland, and devoted their time to the interests of the religion. He and his wife traveled widely among the countries of the Pacific and beyond. On 29 September 1990 he died in Kathmandu, Nepal, while visiting the Baha'is there."

Like many boxers of his day, Jorgensen fought frequently - often twice a month. Jorgensen continued to fight and generally to win, facing tough competition like Redtop Davis, Lulu Perez, Jackie Blair, Carmelo Costa, Victor Manuel Quijano, Harold Gomes, and Battling Torres. Jorgensen retired after a losing to Battling Torres on September 6, 1960. Jorgensen managed to cram an amazing number of fights (93) in a relatively short career (712 years). His final record was 81 wins (35 by knockout), 8 losses, and 4 draws.. Jorgensen died August 6, 2008 in Port Arthur, Texas."

The object of his writing was to build up a rational, philosophical religion to reconcile the ultimate bases of Christianity with the principles of metaphysical philosophy."

In 1878 he began construction of the Larimer and Weld Canal, once known as the Eaton Ditch, which at the time was the largest and longest irrigation canal in the state. In 1879 he built the High Line Canal in Denver for a group of British investors. He later built the Windsor Reservoir near present-day Windsor, and well as many other smaller water projects throughout Larimer and Weld counties. He died in 1904 at Greeley."

He checked out of the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London at seven in the morning, and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station. On February 7, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel in Newport, and drove him around the valleys, including Blackwood (Edwards`` home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the 68 fare in cash."

He likewise painted figures in the architectural pieces of Roque Ponce and of Josef Garcia, as well as groups within the flower-garlands of Gabriel de la Corte. He died at Madrid in 1690."

His rectory was pillaged more than once, and he was carried off to prison, once to Warwick, and again to Banbury. He died at Alkerton, 3 April 1646, and was buried the next day in the chancel of his church. In 1669 a stone was laid over his grave by the society of New College, who also erected a monument, with an inscription to his memory on a black marble table, at the north end of the east cloister of the college."

He then returned to his home in Fasa to seek a master and spiritual guide. It is then that he met and became a disciple of Shaykh Jamal al-Din Abi al-Wafa`` ibn Khalil al-FasaI. While there are no sources to confirm this, it is speculated that Ruzbihan Baqli spent the next years travelling. He went to Syria, Iraq, Kirman, Arabia, and made the hajj (or pilgrimage to Mecca) twice. Finally he returns to Shiraz in 1165 and set up a hospice where he taught for 50 years until his death. His center for Sufi training and his teachings remained popular several generations after his death. He married several wives and had two sons and three daughters. Ruzbihan Baqli died in 1209 in Shiraz and was placed in a tomb in his ribat. For several generations after his death, Ruzbihan Baqli's legacy as a Sufi master continued and Shiraz became a place of pilgrimage. However, the popularity of his order waned and eventually disappeared and his tomb fell into disrepair. In 1972, his tomb was restored by the Iranian Department of Antiquities."

This settlement, that was successfully established by some of the ``old planters'', became Salem, Massachusetts and, in Conant's words, laid the ``foundation'' for the Commonwealth. Conant was its first governor but, in 1627, was replaced by John Endicott. He remained active in town affairs and is today memorialized in a statue across from the Salem Common. He died on November 19, 1679 in Beverly, a nearby town which he also helped found."

In mid-July he was allowed to leave, going to his uncle in Kiev. The following year, he tried to come back to Novgorod at the head of an army but withdrew instead to Pskov, where he died in February 1138. According to his own wishes, he was buried in the Church of St. Demetrius in Pskov."

Moncure, a judge and president of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. Chichester received his early education in private schools in Fairfax County and at St. John's Military Academy in Alexandria. His higher and legal education was received at the University of Virginia. At twenty-one, he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Stafford County, Virginia where he was shortly elected Commonwealth's Attorney. He was elected judge of Stafford and King George Counties in 1898, serving until 1904 when the county courts were abolished. Resuming practice at that time, he entered a law partnership with his brother in Fredericksburg until his appointment, in 1910, as judge of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit. In 1924, he was appointed a judge of the Special Court of Appeals where he served until June 1, 1925. Upon the death of Judge Joseph L. Kelly in June 1925, he was elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. He remained on the court until his death."

He was a member of the family of the last Doge of Genoa, and was born three years after the name of the Adorni was suppressed, and the office of Doge abolished. This measure was taken to put an end to the strife of 165 years between that family and the Fregosi, whose name also was changed. This political revolution was effected by Andrea Doria, the famous Genoese admiral. Francis entered the Society of Jesus in Portugal, whither he had been sent to pursue his studies. He was recalled to Rome, where he taught theology, and gained at the same time the reputation of being one of the greatest orators in Italy. He was the first rector of the College of Milan, and was subsequently charged with the administration of several houses of the Order. He was the friend, adviser, and confessor of St. Charles Borromeo. He died at Genoa."

According to The Knickerbocker Magazine in 1849, Lumley was involved in composer circles, including opera singer, director and composer Signor Guiseppe De Begnis of London and New York, and Thomas Moore of London. De Begnis described Lumley as being an excellent judge of music and possessing accomplished vocal skills, which given his credentials is a supreme compliment. Signor De Begnis was a world-class opera singer who worked with Rossini in Italy and was married to the talented opera soprano Giuseppina Ronzi (Claudine de Begnis). Signor De Begnis dedicated one of his works to Lumley before he died in New York in August 1849."

He graduated B.A. in January 1594, and M.A. (from Corpus Christi College) in May 1603. He had previously taken holy orders, and became chaplain of Corpus Christi College in 1602. He proceeded to the degree of B.D. in June 1610, and in the following year was collated to the vicarage of Hillingdon, which he resigned in 1612, when he became rector of St. Matthew's, Friday Street, London. John King, bishop of London, appointed him his chaplain, and on 14 February 1613 he was collated to St. Andrew Undershaft with St. Mary Axe, London. In 1616 he was installed prebendary of Willesden in St. Paul's Cathedral. This prebend he resigned in March 1637, retaining the rectory of St. Andrew until 1641. When the presbyterians became dominant, he resigned his rectory, and retired to Wigan, where he died early in August 1647, and was buried in Wigan churchyard; he had during his lifetime (in 1632 and 1639) bestowed 240 in trust for the relief of the poor of Wigan. He also gave his library to the grammar school, and made other benefactions to the town."

        "snippet": "When his wife Dorothy Frances became seriously ill during the aftermath of the guerrilla episode Henderson resigned as United States Ambassador to Bolivia in August 1968 and returned to the United States settling with his family in Virginia where his wife would die later that year. He continued his work for the State Department where, despite the seeming success of his ambassadorship, his time in Bolivia had served to undercut Henderson's diplomatic career. This was due in large part due to his unpopularity with the Pentagon and CIA stemming from his early opposition to the 1964 coup by Barrientos and his sometimes rocky relationships with US military officials who resented his efforts to rein in the influence and involvement of American forces during the Guevara insurgency. Also harmful to Henderson's career was a British documentary film that had been made in Bolivia during the height of the insurgency in which Henderson had appeared and given an interview. The film depicted Henderson himself in an unflattering light and in addition was also highly critical of both the United States and the Barrientos regime. The film and Henderson's involvement in it proved a major embarrassment for both him and the State Department. Henderson would go on to hold several mid-level bureaucratic posts in the State Department's Bureau of Inter-American Affairs before being appointed to a sub-ambassadorial post as the Deputy US Representative to the Organization of American States in charge of social and economic issues. It was during this time that he met his second wife Marion, whom he married in 1970. He retired from the State Department in 1975 and returned to his hometown of Weston, Massachusetts where he later began a second career as the president of Land's Sake, a nonprofit group he had co-founded in 1980 to promote the benefits of small-scale land use in farming and educational programming. He died at his home in Weston on July 14, 2010 at the age of 95 following a battle with prostate cancer."

The lieutenant in front of her kicked a tripwire boobytrap, consisting of a mortar shell with a hand grenade attached to the top of it. Chapelle was hit in the neck by a piece of shrapnel which severed her carotid artery and died soon after. Her last moments were captured in a photograph by Henri Huet. Her body was repatriated with an honor guard consisting of six Marines and she was given full Marine burial. She became the first female war correspondent to be killed in Vietnam, as well as the first American female reporter to be killed in action."

        "snippet": "Shortly before the events that would lead to the Portuguese Colonial War, on January 22, 1961, Galvao led the Santa Maria hijacking, also known as Operation Dulcinea. The hijackers, characterized by many as terrorists or rebels, seized the ship and took complete command of the vessel under Galvao's leadership. In this process, they isolated the vessel by cutting off all communication, and killed one officer and wounded several others. Galvao used the hijacking to send radio broadcasts from the ship calling attention to his concerns and views on what he characterized as the Portuguese regime of fascism. The event received wide international press coverage. It is understood that the hijackers forced the captain of the ship, Mario Simoes Maia, along with crew members, to redirect the ship's course. The liner evaded both the U.S. Navy and British Navy for eleven days before docking safely at Recife, Brazil. On February 2, 1961, the hijackers were met by Brazilian officials off the coast of Recife. After negotiating with Brazilian officials, Galvao released the ship's passengers in exchange for his own political asylum in Brazil. Galvao later announced that his original intentions for this operation were to sail the ship to the Portuguese overseas province of Angola. Galvao further claimed that he had planned to declare the independence of Angola from the Portuguese government, in opposition to Antonio de Oliveira Salazar's regime. Galvao remained exiled in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where he subsequently died in 1970."

In 1784, he accepted the post of attorney general for the province of New Brunswick.

In 1790, Bliss married Mary Worthington. He purchased a large home in Saint John formerly owned by Benedict Arnold. He was named Chief Justice of New Brunswick in 1809 and was appointed to the Executive Council of New Brunswick that same year. He remained a judge until his death in Fredericton in 1822 because the government was not prepared to grant him a pension."

        "snippet": "Throughout his life Fleming was a godly protestant and follower of John Calvin. Fleming took holy orders in August 1588 and was ordained deacon and priest by Dr Richard Fletcher at Peterborough Cathedral. Almost as soon as he was ordained Fleming became chaplain to Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral of England, and not chaplain to Catherine Countess of Nottingham as previously thought, although among his papers were prayers said to the Howard family when they were together; in the 1590s Fleming was called as a witness in a court case and stated his occupation as chaplain to Lord Howard. Another error in previous articles about Fleming was that he was an antiquary; he was never a member of the Society of Antiquaries and while he did amass a collection of manuscripts, his motivation for collecting them was not consistent with those of an antiquary. As well as performing the duties of a private chaplain, Fleming was a curate at St Nicholas' Church, Deptford, assisting Reverend Thomas Macander (better known as the man who buried Christopher Marlowe, and possibly Fleming assisted with this burial). Between 1589 and 1606 he preached eight times at St. Paul's Cross, further evidence that he was a trusted ``establishment man''. The sermons are now lost. On 19 October 1593 he was collated by Archbishop John Whitgift to the rectory of St. Pancras, Soper Lane, London. He took his work as a rector as seriously as he did his writing; Fleming saw his parish through at least two plagues. Fleming died at Bottesford, Leicestershire, on 18 September 1607, while on a visit to his brother Samuel, the rector of that parish, and was buried under the chancel inside the church. Despite Fleming's humble origins, his coffin was interred with those of the earls of Rutland. A memorial plaque bearing an epitaph poem written by Fleming marks the approximate site. He was survived by his brother Reverend Samuel Fleming and his sister Hester. Perhaps Fleming's greatest legacy is the fifty known books that he wrote, translated or contributed to."

In 1832, Ridout formed Ridout Brothers and Company, a company dealing in wholesale and retail sales of iron and hardware, with his brother. From 1844 to 1852, he served as president of the Toronto Board of Trade. In 1851, he was elected to Toronto city council and the Toronto public school board of trustees. Ridout also ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1851. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1854. Ridout retired from the hardware business in 1866. He became governor for the British America Assurance Company in 1853 and became manager for the same company in 1871, serving until his death in Toronto at the age of 65."
